# Verona: Where Ancient Rome Meets Shakespearean Romance

There is a moment, on a warm June evening, when the last daylight fades over the Arena di Verona and 15,000 people simultaneously light candles in the ancient Roman amphitheater, transforming it into a constellation of flickering flames. Then the orchestra begins, and the first notes of Aida or Carmen or La Traviata rise into the open sky above a building that has stood for two thousand years, and you realize that this is something no concert hall in the world can replicate — not the sound, not the setting, and certainly not the feeling of sitting where Roman spectators sat, watching art unfold under the same stars.

That moment is the essence of Verona: a city where layers of history do not merely coexist but actively enhance one another, where a Roman arena hosts opera, where a medieval piazza buzzes with modern life, and where the world's most famous love story — fictitious though it may be — has given a real city an enduring romance that you can genuinely feel in its streets, its architecture, and its atmosphere.

We keep returning to Verona because it manages something rare in Italian tourism: it is famous enough to attract visitors, beautiful enough to reward them, and authentic enough to retain its character. The Veronese live in their city, not around it, and the result is a place that feels alive in a way that some more touristed Italian cities do not.

## Why Visit Verona

### A Roman City That Never Stopped Living

Verona's Roman heritage is not confined to a museum or a roped-off ruin. The Arena — the third-largest surviving Roman amphitheater — sits at the center of the modern city, still functioning as a performance venue two millennia after its construction. The Porta Borsari and Porta Leoni (Roman gates) frame streets that still follow the ancient grid. The Roman theater on the hill across the Adige hosts summer performances against a backdrop of cypress trees and medieval towers. The Ponte Pietra, a Roman bridge reconstructed after World War II using original stones recovered from the river, still carries pedestrians across the Adige.

Most cities treat their Roman remains as artifacts. Verona treats them as infrastructure. This continuity of use gives the ancient sites an energy and relevance that static ruins lack.

### Shakespeare's City of Love

Whether or not there were ever real Montagues and Capulets (there were, sort of — the Montecchi and Cappelletti were rival political factions mentioned by Dante), Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet has given Verona an identity as the city of love that it has enthusiastically embraced. Juliet's House on Via Cappello, with its famous balcony (added in the 1930s, but never mind), is one of Italy's most visited sites. Letters to Juliet arrive from around the world, answered by a volunteer group called the Club di Giulietta.

You can approach this with cynicism or with a smile. We recommend the smile. The Romeo and Juliet industry is unashamedly romantic and occasionally kitschy, but it is also genuinely charming, and the broader cultural atmosphere it creates — of a city that celebrates love and beauty — is palpable throughout Verona.

### World-Class Opera in an Ancient Arena

The Arena di Verona opera season runs from mid-June through early September and is one of the great cultural events in Europe. The scale is extraordinary — productions use the full width of the amphitheater for sets that can include pyramids, castles, and triumphal arches. The acoustics are remarkable for an open-air venue. And the atmosphere, with candles flickering across the ancient stone tiers, is utterly unique.

Attending a performance at the Arena should be on every traveler's bucket list, whether you are an opera devotee or someone who has never sat through an aria in your life. The spectacle transcends the music.

### Gateway to Lake Garda

Verona sits just 30 kilometers from the southern shore of Lake Garda, Italy's largest lake. The lake's towns — Sirmione with its thermal baths and Roman ruins, Bardolino with its wine, Malcesine with its cable car to Monte Baldo — make for perfect day trips. A morning in Verona, an afternoon at the lake, and an evening at the opera: that is a day that is hard to improve upon.

## Top Things to Do in Verona

### Attend Opera at the Arena di Verona

The Arena was built in the first century AD to hold 30,000 spectators for gladiatorial combat. Today, it seats 15,000 for opera performances that rank among the most spectacular in the world. The 2025-2026 season features perennial favorites including Aida, Carmen, Tosca, and La Traviata, with occasional modern productions and concerts.

**Practical info:** Tickets range from €30 for unreserved stone seats (gradinata) on the upper tiers to €250 for premium numbered seats (poltronissime) near the stage. The stone seats are an experience in themselves — bring a cushion (vendors sell them outside for €3-5) and arrive early to claim a good position. Performances typically begin at 21:00 or 21:15 and run 2.5-3.5 hours with intermissions. The Arena is open-air, so dress in layers for the evening chill and bring a light rain jacket just in case — performances continue through light rain.

Outside opera season, the Arena is open for visits (€10 entry, free with the Verona Card). Walk through the tunnels, climb to the top tier, and stand on the stage to appreciate the scale.

### Visit Juliet's House (Casa di Giulietta)

Via Cappello, 23. The 13th-century house attributed to the Capulet family features a courtyard entrance (free), the famous balcony (added in 1936 for the tourists, but architecturally convincing), a bronze statue of Juliet (rubbing the right breast is said to bring luck in love — the statue shows the wear), and a museum inside with period furnishings and Romeo and Juliet memorabilia.

**Practical info:** The courtyard and balcony are visible for free from below. Entry to the museum and access to stand on the balcony costs €6. The courtyard is often packed — visit early morning or late afternoon. Love letters can be posted in the mailbox on the courtyard wall, addressed to Juliet.

For a quieter and arguably more atmospheric experience, visit **Romeo's House** (Casa di Romeo) on Via Arche Scaligere — it is not open to the public but the medieval facade is impressive, and the street is free of crowds.

### Explore Piazza delle Erbe

Verona's main square has been the city's marketplace since Roman times, when it served as the forum. Today, it retains that market function with stalls selling produce, souvenirs, and (increasingly) tourist items beneath a canopy of white umbrellas. But the real attraction is the surrounding architecture: the frescoed Casa Mazzanti, the Baroque Palazzo Maffei with its statuary roofline, the medieval Torre del Gardello, the Colonna di San Marco with its winged lion (marking Venetian rule), and the 14th-century fountain with the Madonna Verona statue at its center.

Sit at one of the cafe terraces, order a coffee or a spritz (€4-7), and take in the layers of history. The square is at its best on market mornings and on warm evenings when the Veronese come out to passeggiata.

### Tour Castelvecchio and the Scaligero Bridge

Castelvecchio ("Old Castle") is a 14th-century fortress built by the Scaliger dynasty that ruled Verona for over a century. Its crenellated brick walls and dramatic bridge — the Ponte Scaligero, which arcs across the Adige in a perfect medieval composition — make it one of the most photogenic buildings in northern Italy.

Inside, the Museo di Castelvecchio houses an excellent art collection spanning the medieval to the early modern period, including works by Pisanello, Mantegna, Bellini, Veronese, and Tiepolo. The museum was brilliantly renovated by architect Carlo Scarpa in the 1960s, and his interplay of modern design with medieval architecture is itself a masterwork worth studying.

**Practical info:** Entry €6, free with the Verona Card. Open Tuesday to Sunday 10:00-18:00 (Monday 13:30-18:00). Budget 1-1.5 hours. The bridge is free to walk across at any time and offers beautiful views of the river and the city.

### Climb the Torre dei Lamberti

At 84 meters, the Torre dei Lamberti is the tallest tower in Verona and offers the best panoramic views in the city. An elevator takes you most of the way (with stairs for the final section), and from the top, you can see the Arena, the Adige's elegant bends, the surrounding hills, and — on clear days — the distant Alps.

**Practical info:** Entry €8, or €5 for stairs only. Free with the Verona Card. Open Monday to Friday 10:00-18:00, weekends 11:00-19:00 (hours vary seasonally). The tower is accessed from Piazza delle Erbe through the Palazzo della Ragione courtyard.

### Walk Along the Adige and Cross the Ponte Pietra

The Adige river curves through Verona in a series of sweeping bends, and the riverfront walks are among the most pleasant in any Italian city. The **Ponte Pietra** — a Roman bridge reconstructed after its wartime destruction using original stones salvaged from the riverbed — is the most beautiful crossing, with views upstream toward the hills and downstream toward the city. Cross it to reach the Roman Theater and the hillside of San Pietro, where a short climb rewards you with a panoramic viewpoint over the old city that is particularly magical at sunset.

The **Roman Theater** (Teatro Romano) on the hillside above the Ponte Pietra dates to the first century BC and hosts a summer festival of theater, jazz, and dance (June-August). Entry to the theater and the archaeological museum above it costs €4.50. The museum, housed in a former monastery, has excellent Roman artifacts and one of the best views in Verona from its terrace.

### Day Trip to Sirmione and Lake Garda

The lakeside town of Sirmione, perched on a narrow peninsula jutting into the southern end of Lake Garda, makes a perfect day trip from Verona. The Scaliger Castle at Sirmione's entrance (€6 entry) is spectacularly positioned over the water. The Grotte di Catullo — actually a ruined Roman villa, not caves — occupy the tip of the peninsula with views across the lake to the mountains (€8 entry). The thermal baths of Aquaria offer outdoor pools fed by natural hot springs, some directly on the lakefront (€22 for a half day).

**Practical info:** Buses run from Verona's Porta Nuova station to Sirmione (approximately 40 min, €4-5 each way, operated by ATV). In summer, consider taking the bus one way and returning by ferry via Peschiera del Garda, which has a train station with service back to Verona (20 min, ~€4).

## Where to Eat in Verona

### Osteria al Duca — Traditional Veronese (€€)

Via Arche Scaligere, 2. Located on the street behind Juliet's House (and infinitely more rewarding), Osteria al Duca serves classic Veronese cuisine in a warm, unpretentious setting. The bigoli con ragù d'asina (thick spaghetti with donkey ragù, €11) is a local specialty you will not find easily outside the Veneto. The pastissada de caval (horse-meat stew, €14) is another traditional dish worth trying if you are adventurous. A full dinner with wine costs €25-35 per person. Reservations recommended for dinner.

### Trattoria al Pompiere — Since 1880 (€€-€€€)

Vicolo Regina d'Ungheria, 5. This venerable trattoria near Piazza delle Erbe has been serving Veronese cuisine for over 140 years, and the quality remains remarkably high. The risotto all'Amarone (made with the famous local red wine, €15) is a signature dish, rich and deeply flavored. The Monte Veronese cheese selection (€9) showcases local dairy traditions. A full dinner costs €35-50 per person. The wine list is outstanding, particularly for local Valpolicella and Amarone wines. Reservations essential.

### Pizzeria Du de Cope — Best Pizza in Verona (€)

Galleria Pellicciai, 10. In a gallery off Piazza Bra, Du de Cope serves Naples-quality pizza at prices that seem almost generous for a location this central. Margherita €7, pizza with burrata and prosciutto crudo €10. The crusts are properly charred and pillowy, and the ingredients are first-rate. A full meal with a drink costs €12-18 per person. Open for lunch and dinner; expect queues at peak times.

### Antica Bottega del Vino — Wine Institution (€€-€€€)

Via Scudo di Francia, 3. Operating since 1890, this legendary wine bar and restaurant has one of the deepest Italian wine lists in existence — over 3,000 labels, with particular strength in Veneto wines. Come for a glass of Amarone at the bar (from €8) or sit down for a full meal of refined Veronese cuisine. The risotto with tastasal (a local pork preparation, €14) and the bollito misto (mixed boiled meats, €18) are excellent. A full dinner with fine wine costs €45-70 per person. The standing-room bar area is more casual and significantly less expensive.

### Gelateria Savoia — Best Gelato (€)

Via Roma, 1b. Steps from the Arena, Savoia has been making gelato since 1939. The pistachio is exceptional, and the seasonal fruit flavors (fragola in spring, fico in late summer) use genuinely ripe local produce. A medium cup costs €2.50-3.50. Open daily from late morning until after the opera crowd disperses.

## Where to Stay in Verona

### Budget: Ostello di Verona — From €28/Night

Salita Fontana del Ferro, 15. Verona's HI-affiliated hostel occupies a beautiful 16th-century villa on the hillside above the Roman Theater, with a terrace offering panoramic views over the old city. Dorm beds from €28; private doubles from €70. The location is slightly uphill from the center (a 15-minute walk across the Ponte Pietra) but the setting is hard to beat. Breakfast included. Curfew at midnight, which can be limiting during opera season.

### Mid-Range: Hotel Giulietta e Romeo — From €110/Night

Vicolo Tre Marchetti, 3. The name is predictable (this is Verona, after all), but the hotel itself is genuinely good: a well-located three-star property steps from the Arena, with comfortable rooms, helpful staff, and a breakfast spread that goes well beyond the Italian minimum. Doubles from €110-180 depending on season. The premium rooms with Arena views (from €160) are worth the upgrade if available.

### Luxury: Hotel Gabbia d'Oro — From €280/Night

Corso Porta Borsari, 4a. A five-star boutique hotel in a meticulously restored medieval palazzo, the Gabbia d'Oro ("Golden Cage") occupies one of the most beautiful buildings in the old city. Frescoed ceilings, period furnishings, a winter garden for breakfast, and a location between Piazza delle Erbe and the Arena. Doubles from €280; suites from €450. The intimate scale (27 rooms) ensures personal service that larger luxury hotels struggle to match.

## Practical Tips for Verona

<div class="scott-tips">

### Scott's Tips for Verona

**Buy the Verona Card.** Available in 24-hour (€20) or 48-hour (€25) versions, it includes free entry to major attractions (Arena, Juliet's House museum, Castelvecchio, Torre dei Lamberti, Roman Theater, San Zeno) and free local bus travel. It pays for itself within 2-3 sites. Purchase at any participating attraction or tourist office.

**Book opera tickets early, but do not overspend.** The unreserved stone seats (gradinata, €30-35) are the authentic Arena experience. You sit on 2,000-year-old stone, you are higher up (better for the full visual spectacle), and you participate in the candle-lighting tradition. Bring a cushion and arrive 30-45 minutes early for the best spots. Premium seats offer comfort and proximity to the stage, but the atmosphere in the upper tiers is unbeatable.

**Visit Piazza delle Erbe early or late.** By midday, the square fills with tour groups and market stalls obscure the architecture. Come before 9:00 for photographs of the empty square in morning light, or after 20:00 when the market has packed up and the piazza transforms into an elegant evening gathering place.

**Drink Valpolicella, especially Amarone.** Verona is the capital of one of Italy's great wine regions. Valpolicella Classico (from €4/glass) is the everyday red; Ripasso (from €6/glass) is richer; and Amarone della Valpolicella (from €8-15/glass) is one of Italy's most powerful and complex wines. Visit any enoteca in the old city for a tasting education. The Valpolicella wine region itself is a 20-minute drive north and offers cellar visits and tastings (many from €15-25 per person including wines and light food).

**Do not skip San Zeno Maggiore.** This Romanesque basilica on the western edge of the centro storico is, in our opinion, the finest church in Verona — more impressive than the Duomo and far less crowded. The bronze door panels depicting biblical scenes, the crypt with the remains of San Zeno, and the Mantegna altarpiece in the apse are all outstanding. Entry €3, or free with the Verona Card.

**Cross the river for the best views.** The hill of San Pietro, reached via the Ponte Pietra and a short climb, offers the definitive panorama of Verona: the river curving through the city, the Arena rising above the rooftops, the towers and domes of the old city arranged against the backdrop of the Lessini hills. Come at sunset for peak beauty. The Castel San Pietro terrace at the top has a bar (drinks €5-8) with outdoor seating — the perfect sundowner spot.

**Verona in December is magical.** The Christmas markets in Piazza dei Signori transform the square into a warmly lit wonderland of wooden stalls selling crafts, food, and vin brulé (mulled wine, €3-4). The entire old city is decorated, and the atmosphere is genuinely enchanting. A different kind of Verona visit, but a wonderful one.

**Use Verona as a base for the Veneto.** The city's rail connections make it ideal for day trips: Venice (1 hr), Padua (45 min), Vicenza (25 min), Mantua (40 min), and Lake Garda (30-40 min by bus). You could spend a week based in Verona and explore a different masterpiece of northern Italian culture every day.

**The passeggiata on Via Mazzini is a nightly ritual.** Every evening, the Veronese stroll the pedestrian shopping street connecting Piazza Bra to Piazza delle Erbe, dressed with that effortless Italian elegance that the rest of us can only admire. Join the flow — it is free entertainment and the best way to feel the pulse of the city.

## Getting Around Verona

Verona's centro storico is compact and entirely walkable. The Arena, Juliet's House, Piazza delle Erbe, and Castelvecchio are all within a 15-minute walk of one another. The only time you might need public transport is for the train station (a 15-minute walk from the Arena) or for reaching the youth hostel on the hillside.

ATV buses serve the city and surrounding area. Single tickets cost €1.30 (valid for 75 minutes, buy at tabacchi shops) or are included free with the Verona Card. A taxi from the train station to the Arena costs approximately €10-12.

Verona Porta Nuova train station is the main station, with high-speed connections in all directions. The smaller Verona Porta Vescovo station is closer to the eastern side of the old city but serves only regional trains.

## How Many Days Do You Need in Verona

Two full days is our recommended minimum: one for the old city sights (Arena, Juliet's House, Piazza delle Erbe, Castelvecchio, Torre dei Lamberti, San Zeno) and one for the Roman Theater, the river walks, the wine bars, and a more relaxed pace of exploration. If you are attending the opera (and you should be), add the evening accordingly — performances end late.

Three days allows for a Lake Garda day trip or a Valpolicella wine excursion. Four days lets you add Mantua or Vicenza as day trips. A full week based in Verona, using it as a hub for the Veneto, is a strategy we enthusiastically endorse.

## A Day in Verona: Suggested Itinerary

**Morning:** Start at the Arena (opens 10:00 on most days) and spend 30-45 minutes exploring the amphitheater. Walk through the elegant Piazza Bra and down Via Mazzini to Piazza delle Erbe for a mid-morning coffee. Explore the square and the adjacent Piazza dei Signori with the Scaliger Tombs.

**Late Morning:** Visit Juliet's House courtyard (free) and, if interested, the museum (€6). Walk to the Torre dei Lamberti for the panoramic view (€8).

**Lunch:** Eat at Osteria al Duca or Pizzeria Du de Cope.

**Afternoon:** Tour Castelvecchio and the Ponte Scaligero (€6). Cross the river via Ponte Pietra and climb to Castel San Pietro for sunset views. Visit the Roman Theater if time allows.

**Evening:** Aperitivo in Piazza delle Erbe (spritz, €5-7), dinner at Trattoria al Pompiere or Antica Bottega del Vino, and — if it is summer — opera at the Arena.

## Final Thoughts

Verona is the Italian city that has everything — Roman ruins, medieval architecture, Renaissance art, world-class gastronomy, legendary wine, and the best open-air opera venue on the planet — but wears it all with a modesty that is almost disarming. It does not shout for attention the way Rome does, or dazzle with the intensity of Florence, or enchant with the otherworldliness of Venice. What it does is deliver, quietly and consistently, one of the most satisfying city experiences in Italy.

The Arena alone would justify a visit. The opera transforms it into something unforgettable. The food and wine make you want to stay. And the sense, walking the old streets in the evening, that you are in a city that has been beautiful and alive for two thousand years and shows no signs of slowing down — that is what brings us back to Verona, again and again.

Come for Romeo and Juliet if you like. Stay for the Amarone, the Arena, and the sunset from San Pietro. Leave knowing that Verona, for all its fame, is still one of Italy's most underrated cities — and that is precisely what makes it so good.
