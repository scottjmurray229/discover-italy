  - question: "What is the best time to visit Pompeii?"
    answer: "April, May, September, October, and November offer the best conditions — mild weather, fewer crowds, and comfortable temperatures for the extensive outdoor walking required. Summer months (June-August) bring intense heat with little shade across the ruins, making long visits exhausting."
  - question: "How much does it cost to visit Pompeii?"
    answer: "Entry to the Pompeii archaeological site costs €18 for adults (free for EU citizens under 18). A combined ticket with Herculaneum and other Vesuvian sites costs €22. Guided tours typically run €15-20 per person for group tours or €120-180 for a private 2-hour tour. Budget travelers can visit Pompeii as a day trip from Naples for as little as €35 total."
  - question: "How do I get to Pompeii?"
    answer: "The easiest route is the Circumvesuviana train from Naples Garibaldi station to Pompei Scavi-Villa dei Misteri (35 minutes, €3.60). The station is directly outside the main entrance (Porta Marina). You can also take the Campania Express (€8, more comfortable, reserved seating) or drive and park at the site."
  - question: "Is Pompeii safe for tourists?"
    answer: "The archaeological site itself is very safe with security staff throughout. The surrounding modern town of Pompei is generally safe but unremarkable. On the Circumvesuviana train, keep an eye on your belongings as petty theft can occur on crowded services. Wear sturdy shoes — the ancient stone streets are uneven and can be slippery."

# Pompeii: Walking Through the Ancient World

On the morning of August 24, 79 AD, the residents of Pompeii went about their ordinary lives. Bakers kneaded dough. Merchants opened their shops on the Via dell'Abbondanza. Children played in the Forum. A dog strained at its chain in the House of the Tragic Poet. By the following morning, every one of them was dead, and their city lay buried under six meters of volcanic ash and pumice from the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

Nearly two thousand years later, we walk the same streets they walked, peer into the same rooms where they ate and slept and argued, and stand in the same forum where they gathered to gossip and trade. Pompeii is not merely an archaeological site — it is a complete ancient city, frozen at the moment of its destruction and preserved with a fidelity that nowhere else on earth can match. It is haunting, awe-inspiring, and profoundly moving, and it is one of those rare places that lives up to every word of its reputation.

## Why Pompeii Matters

### A Complete Roman City, Not Just Ruins

Most ancient Roman sites survive as fragments — a column here, a foundation there, perhaps a section of wall or a stretch of road. Pompeii is fundamentally different. Because the volcanic material sealed the city so quickly and so completely, what survives is not a fragment but an entire urban environment: streets with ruts from cart wheels, houses with frescoes still vivid on the walls, taverns with menus scratched into the plaster, a brothel with explicit paintings advertising its services, bakeries with mills still in place, a 20,000-seat amphitheater, temples, baths, fountains, and the intimate personal objects of daily life — jewelry, surgical instruments, cooking pots, children's toys.

Walking through Pompeii, you do not need to imagine what a Roman city looked like. You can see it, touch its walls, and stand in its rooms. This immediacy is what makes the site so powerful.

### The Human Story

The plaster casts of Pompeii's victims are among the most emotionally affecting objects in all of archaeology. In the 19th century, archaeologist Giuseppe Fiorelli realized that the voids left in the hardened ash by decomposed bodies could be filled with plaster, creating eerily detailed casts of people in their final moments. A mother sheltering her child. A man covering his face. A dog writhing against its chain. These are not abstractions — they are individuals, and standing before them collapses the distance between then and now in a way that no textbook or documentary can achieve.

### Scale and Scope

The excavated area of Pompeii covers approximately 44 hectares — about 109 acres — making it one of the largest archaeological sites in the world. Even today, roughly a third of the city remains unexcavated. What has been uncovered reveals a sophisticated, cosmopolitan city of perhaps 11,000 residents with a level of urban planning, civic infrastructure, and cultural life that would not be matched in Europe for more than a thousand years after its destruction.

## Top Things to See at Pompeii

### The Forum (Foro)

The Forum was the beating heart of Pompeian civic life — the combined marketplace, courthouse, religious center, and social hub of the city. The rectangular open space, originally paved with travertine, is framed by the remains of once-grand civic buildings: the Basilica (law courts), the Temple of Jupiter (with Vesuvius looming directly behind it in a composition that feels almost theatrical), the Macellum (covered food market), and the Building of Eumachia (headquarters of the fullers' guild, Pompeii's most important trade).

Stand at the northern end of the Forum and face south: the columns, the mountain, the empty space where thousands once gathered — it is the single most evocative view at the site.

### Villa of the Mysteries (Villa dei Misteri)

Located just outside the city walls near the Porta Marina entrance, the Villa of the Mysteries houses the most remarkable surviving frescoes from the ancient world. The "Mystery Frieze" — a continuous cycle of paintings running around the walls of a single room — depicts a series of ritualistic scenes believed to relate to initiation into the cult of Dionysus. The figures are life-sized, the colors astonishingly vivid after two millennia, and the emotional intensity of the scenes is extraordinary. Whatever these paintings meant to their original viewers, their power to fascinate has not diminished.

The villa itself is also notable as a fine example of a wealthy Roman country estate, with rooms arranged around a central peristyle garden.

### The Amphitheatre (Anfiteatro)

Built around 70 BC, Pompeii's amphitheatre is the oldest known stone amphitheatre in the Roman world — it predates the Colosseum by over a century. With a capacity of approximately 20,000 spectators, it hosted gladiatorial combat, animal hunts, and the occasional riot (a brawl between Pompeians and visitors from nearby Nuceria in 59 AD was serious enough that the Roman Senate banned games here for ten years).

The amphitheatre sits at the far eastern end of the site, so many visitors miss it. Do not be one of them — the walk is worth it, and the elliptical structure, nearly intact, is deeply impressive. Climb to the upper tiers for excellent views over the site and toward Vesuvius.

### House of the Faun (Casa del Fauno)

The largest private residence in Pompeii, covering an entire city block, the House of the Faun takes its name from the bronze dancing faun statue in its impluvium (rainwater pool — the statue on display is a replica; the original is in the Naples Archaeological Museum). The house originally contained the extraordinary Alexander Mosaic, depicting the Battle of Issus between Alexander the Great and Darius III — one of the greatest artworks to survive from antiquity (now also in the Naples museum, and absolutely worth seeing there).

Even without its most famous artwork, the house impresses through sheer scale and architectural sophistication. Two atria, two peristyle gardens, elaborate floor mosaics, and a layout that speaks of extraordinary wealth.

### The Plaster Casts

Several locations around the site display plaster casts of victims, but the most comprehensive and sensitively presented collection is in the Granary of the Forum (Granai del Foro), housed in the building on the western side of the Forum. Here, glass cases contain casts of men, women, children, and animals in their final positions, along with everyday objects found in the ruins — amphorae, cooking vessels, architectural fragments, and other artifacts.

The displays have been reorganized in recent years to treat the casts with greater dignity and archaeological rigor. Viewing them is a profoundly emotional experience that serves as a necessary counterweight to the archaeological wonder of the rest of the site: these were real people, and this was a real catastrophe.

### Lupanar (The Brothel)

Pompeii's most famous brothel (the city had several) is a small, somewhat cramped two-story building with stone beds in individual cubicles and explicit frescoes above each doorway — essentially an illustrated menu of services. It is one of the most visited structures at the site, and the queues can be long. The building offers a remarkably frank glimpse into the sexual commerce of ancient Rome, though the small rooms and their stone "beds" (originally covered with mattresses) also invite reflection on the conditions of the women — many of them enslaved — who worked here.

### The Baths

Pompeii had several public bath complexes, and visiting at least one is essential for understanding Roman daily life. The **Stabian Baths** (Terme Stabiane) are the oldest and most complete, with well-preserved changing rooms, cold pools (frigidarium), warm rooms (tepidarium), and hot rooms (caldarium) with sophisticated heating systems visible beneath the raised floors. The **Forum Baths** (Terme del Foro) are smaller but beautifully decorated, with fine stucco ceiling work in the tepidarium.

## Practical Information for Visiting Pompeii

### Entry Fees and Tickets

- **Standard adult entry:** €18
- **EU citizens aged 18-25:** €2
- **EU citizens under 18 and over 65:** Free
- **Combined ticket (Pompeii + Herculaneum + Boscoreale + Oplontis + Stabiae):** €22 (valid for 3 days)
- **First Sunday of the month:** Free entry for all visitors (expect very large crowds)

Purchase tickets online in advance at ticketone.it to skip the ticket queue. During peak season (April-October), the ticket line can stretch to 30-45 minutes.

### Opening Hours

- **April to October:** 9:00 - 19:00 (last entry 17:30)
- **November to March:** 9:00 - 17:00 (last entry 15:30)
- Closed January 1, May 1, and December 25.

### How Much Time Do You Need?

A minimum of **3 hours** allows you to see the highlights at a brisk pace. We recommend **4-5 hours** for a thorough visit without feeling rushed. Dedicated archaeology enthusiasts can easily spend a full day. The site is vast — even with 5 hours, you will not see everything.

### Guided Tours

A knowledgeable guide transforms a Pompeii visit from impressive to unforgettable. Guides bring the empty rooms to life with stories, context, and details you would never notice on your own.

- **Group tours:** Licensed guides offer 2-hour group tours from the entrance for approximately €15-20 per person. Quality varies — look for guides with official Campania region credentials.
- **Private tours:** A private guide for 2-3 hours costs €120-180 for a group of up to 5 people. Worth the investment, especially for families.
- **Audio guides:** Available at the entrance for €8. Useful but less engaging than a human guide.

### What to Bring

- **Water:** At least 1.5 liters per person. There are a few fountains on-site (Roman-era water still flows at some of them), and a cafeteria near the Forum, but hydration is critical in warm weather.
- **Sturdy shoes:** The ancient cobblestone streets are deeply uneven, with ruts, gaps, and loose stones. Sandals and flip-flops are a recipe for twisted ankles.
- **Sun protection:** Most of the site is fully exposed. Hat, sunscreen, and sunglasses are essential from April through October.
- **A map or downloaded guide:** The free site map is helpful but basic. Download the official MyPompeii app for navigation and context.

## Where to Eat Near Pompeii

The restaurants immediately outside the archaeological site (on Via Plinio and Via Roma) are mostly tourist traps with mediocre food at inflated prices. We strongly recommend either eating inside the site at the **cafeteria near the Forum** (basic but reasonably priced sandwiches and drinks, €5-10 for a quick lunch), or venturing slightly further into the modern town of Pompei or taking the train back to Naples for a proper meal.

### President Pompei — Modern Town (€€)

Piazza Schettini, 12. A short walk from the site, this restaurant offers well-executed Campanian cuisine at fair prices. The fried appetizers (cuoppo, €8) are excellent, and the pasta e fagioli (€10) is hearty and authentic. A full lunch costs €20-30 per person.

### Ristorante Lucullus — Modern Town (€€)

Via Plinio, 129. Better than most Via Plinio options, Lucullus offers a fixed-price tourist menu (€15-18) that is actually decent — fresh buffalo mozzarella, a pasta course, and a drink. The quality is honest if unspectacular.

### Eat in Naples Instead

If your schedule permits, we recommend saving your appetite for Naples. The Circumvesuviana returns you to the city in 35 minutes, and the food in Naples' centro storico is in an entirely different league. Sorbillo for pizza (€5-8), Tandem for ragù (€10-12), or Di Matteo for a fried pizza on the go (€3) — any of these will provide a far more memorable meal than anything adjacent to the ruins.

## Where to Stay Near Pompeii

Most visitors treat Pompeii as a day trip from Naples or Sorrento, and we think this is the right approach. The modern town of Pompei is functional but not a place you will want to linger. However, if you prefer to stay close to the site:

### Budget: Camping Spartacus — From €25/Night

Via Plinio, 127. Basic but clean accommodations in bungalows and tent pitches, a short walk from the Porta Marina entrance. Bungalows for two from €45; tent pitches from €25. A pool provides welcome relief after a hot day at the ruins.

### Mid-Range: Hotel Forum Pompei — From €85/Night

Via Roma, 99. A comfortable three-star hotel within sight of the excavations. Rooms are modern and air-conditioned — a genuine luxury after a day in the sun. The rooftop terrace has views of Vesuvius. Doubles from €85-120.

### Luxury: Bosco de' Medici — From €180/Night

Via Settembrini, 8. A wine estate and boutique hotel in a converted 18th-century farmhouse on the slopes of Vesuvius. The property includes a pool, wine tastings, and a restaurant serving estate wines with local cuisine. It is the most atmospheric option near Pompeii and a genuine pleasure to return to after a day exploring the ruins. Doubles from €180-250.

## Practical Tips for Pompeii

<div class="scott-tips">

### Scott's Tips for Pompeii

**Enter through Porta Marina, exit through Piazza Anfiteatro (or vice versa).** The site has three entrances. Starting at Porta Marina (nearest to the Circumvesuviana station) and walking east through the site to exit at Piazza Anfiteatro gives you a logical route that covers the major sights without backtracking. If you want to end near the train, reverse the route.

**Go early or go late.** The site opens at 9:00. Arriving at opening means you will have the Forum nearly to yourself for the first 30-45 minutes before the tour bus groups arrive. Alternatively, entering after 14:00 (summer) or 13:00 (winter) means thinning crowds as day-trippers depart.

**Visit the Naples Archaeological Museum before or after Pompeii.** Many of Pompeii's greatest treasures — the Alexander Mosaic, the Farnese Collection, the Secret Cabinet of erotic art, thousands of everyday objects — were removed to the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli (MANN) for preservation. The museum (€18 entry) provides essential context that makes the ruins far more meaningful. See them together, in either order.

**Do not skip the Amphitheatre.** It is at the far end of the site, and tired visitors often turn back before reaching it. This is a mistake — it is the oldest stone amphitheatre in the Roman world, and the walk passes through the fascinating Regio II neighborhoods with some of the best-preserved houses.

**The Circumvesuviana train is functional, not comfortable.** Expect crowding, occasional delays, and a general atmosphere that is more utilitarian than scenic. Keep your belongings close and your patience intact. The €8 Campania Express is a more comfortable alternative with air conditioning and reserved seats.

**Combine Pompeii with Herculaneum if you have two days.** Herculaneum (Ercolano) was destroyed by the same eruption but preserved differently — by superheated pyroclastic flows rather than ash and pumice. The site is smaller but even better preserved, with intact upper floors, original wooden beams, and carbonized furniture. Entry is €13, or use the combined ticket.

**Combine with Vesuvius if you are fit.** From the Pompei Scavi station area, buses (€3.60) run to the Vesuvius crater car park at 1,000 meters elevation. From there, a 30-minute hike on a gravel path reaches the crater rim (€10 entry). The views into the crater and across the Bay of Naples are spectacular. Budget 3-4 hours for the Vesuvius excursion on top of your Pompeii visit.

**First Sunday of the month is free but chaotic.** If you visit on a Domenica al Museo free-entry day, expect enormous queues and packed conditions at major structures. We recommend paying the €18 on a regular day for a dramatically better experience.

**Photograph the details, not just the vistas.** The most fascinating things at Pompeii are often small: graffiti scratched into walls ("Successus the weaver is in love with the barmaid"), stepping stones across streets, lead water pipes with manufacturer stamps, ruts worn into stone by two thousand years of cart traffic. Look down, look closely, and look at the margins.

## A Suggested Route Through Pompeii (4-5 Hours)

For those who want a structured plan, here is our recommended route:

1. **Enter at Porta Marina** (9:00) — Begin at the Antiquarium museum just inside the gate for orientation.
2. **The Forum** (9:15-9:45) — Take in the central square, the Temple of Jupiter, and the Granary (plaster casts).
3. **Forum Baths** (9:45-10:00) — Compact but beautifully preserved.
4. **House of the Tragic Poet** (10:00-10:15) — Famous "Cave Canem" (Beware of the Dog) mosaic.
5. **House of the Faun** (10:15-10:30) — Pompeii's grandest private residence.
6. **Via dell'Abbondanza** (10:30-11:15) — The main commercial street, with shops, taverns, and the Lupanar.
7. **Stabian Baths** (11:15-11:30) — The oldest bath complex.
8. **Teatro Grande and Odeon** (11:30-11:45) — The large theater and its smaller covered companion.
9. **House of Menander** (11:45-12:00) — Outstanding frescoes and mosaics.
10. **Amphitheatre and Palestra** (12:00-12:30) — The oldest stone amphitheatre and the adjacent training ground.
11. **Garden of the Fugitives** (12:30-12:45) — Deeply moving plaster casts in a garden setting.
12. **Return via the southern streets** to the Forum area, or exit at Piazza Anfiteatro.
13. **Villa of the Mysteries** (13:00-13:30) — Walk west from the Forum along Via dei Sepolcri to end at this extraordinary villa.

Adjust timing based on your pace and interests. This route covers approximately 4 kilometers of walking on uneven ground.

## Pompeii with Children

Pompeii can be a remarkable experience for children, but it requires some planning. The vast open spaces with no shade exhaust young legs quickly, and the academic signage is not designed for younger visitors.

Our recommendations: hire a private guide who specializes in family tours (many do — ask at booking), focus on the "cool factor" sites (the amphitheatre, the bakeries with their stone mills, the plaster casts, the mosaics), and plan for a shorter visit of 2-3 hours rather than attempting the full site. Bring snacks, water, and sunscreen in abundance. A stroller is not practical on the ancient streets.

## Final Thoughts

Pompeii is one of those places that changes how you see the ancient world. Before visiting, Roman history can feel abstract — dates and emperors and conquests arranged neatly in textbooks. After walking through Pompeii's streets, peering into its kitchens, reading its graffiti, and standing before the plaster casts of its dead, the ancient world becomes real in a way that is both exhilarating and sobering.

This was a living city, full of living people, and their sudden destruction preserved them for us with a terrible clarity. We owe it to them — and to ourselves — to visit with attention, respect, and enough time to truly see what the ash preserved. Pompeii is not a ruin. It is a time capsule, and opening it is one of travel's most profound experiences.
