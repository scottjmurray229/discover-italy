# Tuscany: Where Every Hilltop Tells a Story

Tuscany is the Italy of the imagination. When people close their eyes and picture Italy -- the cypress-lined roads, the medieval hill towns, the vineyards rolling toward a distant bell tower, the light that turns everything to gold in the late afternoon -- they are picturing Tuscany. And the extraordinary thing about this region is that the reality does not merely meet the dream. It surpasses it.

We have spent weeks at a time driving Tuscany's white gravel roads, eating in its trattorias, tasting in its cellars, and wandering its Renaissance streets, and each visit reveals new layers. A hilltop village we had never heard of. A family winery making exceptional Brunello in a barn. A Romanesque church standing alone in a wheat field with frescoes that no one visits. Tuscany rewards curiosity, and it rewards slowing down.

This is a region that gave the world the Renaissance, that shaped the Italian language itself (modern Italian is essentially the Tuscan dialect, codified by Dante), and that continues to produce some of the planet's finest wines, olive oils, and artisanal foods. But beyond all the cultural and culinary superlatives, Tuscany offers something harder to quantify: a quality of life, a rhythm of days, a relationship between humans and landscape that feels deeply, enviably right.

## Why Visit Tuscany

Tuscany is the rare destination that truly has something for everyone. Art lovers have the Renaissance masterpieces of Florence, Siena, and Arezzo. Wine enthusiasts have Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino, and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano -- three of Italy's greatest wine regions within easy driving distance of each other. Foodies have a farm-to-table culinary tradition that the rest of the world is still trying to catch up with. Hikers and cyclists have endless trails through some of Europe's most photogenic landscapes. History buffs have Etruscan tombs, Roman ruins, medieval fortifications, and Renaissance palaces.

And then there is the countryside itself. The Val d'Orcia, in southern Tuscany, is a UNESCO World Heritage landscape -- a composition of undulating wheat fields, isolated farmhouses, clusters of cypress trees, and distant hill towns that seems to have been arranged by the hand of an artist with perfect aesthetic judgment. Driving through it, especially in the soft light of early morning or late afternoon, is one of the great visual experiences of European travel.

## Top Things to Do

### Explore Siena and the Piazza del Campo

Siena is Florence's great rival, and in many ways it is the more purely enjoyable city to visit. Its heart is the Piazza del Campo, a scallop-shaped medieval square that is widely considered the most beautiful piazza in Italy. The square slopes gently downward toward the Palazzo Pubblico and its soaring Torre del Mangia, and it functions as Siena's collective living room -- locals and visitors sit on the warm brick paving, share bottles of wine, and watch the sky change colors above the Gothic palaces.

Climb the Torre del Mangia (€10, 400 steps) for a panoramic view that reveals Siena's extraordinary urban plan -- a medieval city that grew organically along three ridges and has barely changed in 600 years. The Palazzo Pubblico's Museo Civico (€10) houses Ambrogio Lorenzetti's famous Allegory of Good and Bad Government frescoes, which are worth the visit alone.

Siena's Duomo (cathedral complex entry from €15 for the combined pass) is a masterpiece of Italian Gothic architecture, with a striped marble exterior, an astonishing inlaid marble floor (fully uncovered only in autumn), and the stunning Piccolomini Library with its vibrant Pinturicchio frescoes.

If you visit on July 2nd or August 16th, you will witness the Palio -- the legendary bareback horse race around the Piazza del Campo that has been run since 1644. The race itself lasts about 90 seconds, but the pageantry, neighborhood rivalries, and sheer emotional intensity make it one of Italy's most unforgettable experiences. The piazza is free to enter (arrive by 2:00 PM and prepare to stand for hours), while balcony seats cost €300-800.

### Drive Through the Val d'Orcia

The Val d'Orcia is southern Tuscany's crown jewel -- a landscape so perfectly composed that UNESCO recognized it not for a single monument but for the beauty of the landscape itself. The best way to experience it is by car, driving slowly along the SP146 and side roads, stopping whenever the view demands it (which is approximately every five minutes).

Key stops include the hilltop town of Pienza, a Renaissance "ideal city" redesigned by Pope Pius II in the 15th century with a beautiful main square and outstanding pecorino cheese shops (tasting is free and encouraged). Nearby Monticchiello is a tiny walled village with a community theater tradition and stunning views. The iconic cypress-lined road near the Agriturismo Poggio Covili (near Castiglione d'Orcia) is one of the most photographed spots in Italy.

The Bagno Vignoni thermal springs are a unique stop -- the village's main piazza is actually a large thermal pool built by the Medici, and the free public thermal stream at the Parco dei Mulini below the village lets you soak in hot natural water surrounded by countryside. The more developed Bagni San Filippo hot springs, further south, are also free and feature striking white calcite formations.

### Wine Tasting in Chianti

The Chianti wine region stretches between Florence and Siena, a landscape of vine-covered hills, stone farmhouses, and cypress-punctuated horizons. The wines produced here -- primarily from the Sangiovese grape -- range from the approachable Chianti Classico to the structured, age-worthy Gran Selezione bottlings.

We recommend visiting 2-3 wineries per day, booking ahead for the best experiences. Castello di Ama (tastings from €25) combines world-class Chianti Classico with a remarkable contemporary art collection installed throughout the estate. Fontodi in Panzano (tastings from €20) produces some of the region's most consistent wines, and owner Giovanni Manetti is passionate about organic viticulture. Badia a Coltibuono (tastings from €18) is a former medieval abbey surrounded by vineyards, with an excellent cooking school (classes from €100) and restaurant.

For a more casual experience, the town of Greve in Chianti has an enoteca on the main piazza where you can taste dozens of local wines by the glass (€3-8) and stock up on bottles at cellar-door prices.

### Climb the Towers of San Gimignano

San Gimignano is medieval Manhattan -- a hilltop town that bristles with 14 surviving stone towers (of an original 72) built by competing noble families in the 12th and 13th centuries. The effect is extraordinary and totally unique. From a distance, the skyline looks like a medieval dreamscape; up close, the towers create dramatic shadows in the narrow streets below.

The Torre Grossa (€9, combined ticket with the civic museum) is the only tower you can climb, and the views from the top encompass the entire Val d'Elsa and distant Tuscan hills. The main piazza has two excellent gelaterias locked in a famous rivalry -- Gelateria Dondoli (multiple world gelato champion, try the Crema di Santa Fina with saffron, €3) and Gelateria di Piazza. We recommend trying both and declaring your own winner.

San Gimignano's Vernaccia di San Gimignano -- Tuscany's only DOCG white wine -- is underrated and pairs beautifully with the local saffron-infused dishes. The Rocca fortress garden (free entry) at the top of town is the best spot for a quiet moment with panoramic views.

**Warning:** San Gimignano is heavily touristed during the day. Visit early morning or late afternoon when the day-trip buses have departed, and the town reveals its genuine character.

### Visit Montepulciano and Montalcino

These two hill towns, both in southern Tuscany, are temples to Italian wine. Montepulciano produces Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, an elegant Sangiovese-based red, while Montalcino is home to Brunello di Montalcino, one of Italy's greatest and most age-worthy wines.

In Montepulciano, the Contucci wine cellar (free tastings) occupies a Renaissance palace right on the main piazza and has been in the same family since the 1400s. The town itself is a steep, beautiful climb from the lower gate to the Piazza Grande at the top, lined with Renaissance palaces and churches. The Tempio di San Biagio, a perfect Renaissance church just outside the town walls, is worth the short walk.

Montalcino is smaller and more wine-focused. Visit the imposing 14th-century Fortezza (€6) for wine tasting on the ramparts, choosing from an extensive Brunello list (glasses from €5-15 depending on producer and vintage). For a proper winery visit, Casanova di Neri (tastings from €30) and Biondi-Santi (the estate that essentially invented Brunello, tastings from €50) offer unforgettable experiences. The weekly Saturday market in the main piazza is excellent for local cheeses, honey, and salumi.

## Where to Eat

### Trattoria Latte di Luna (Pienza) -- Authentic Tuscan

On a quiet street in Pienza, this family-run trattoria serves textbook Tuscan cooking at honest prices. The pici all'aglione (hand-rolled fat spaghetti with garlic-tomato sauce, €10) is the signature -- rustic, satisfying, and perfect. Their ribollita (Tuscan bread and vegetable soup, €8) is thick enough to stand a spoon in. Grilled bistecca (€18) and tagliata di manzo (sliced steak, €20) are excellent. House wine comes in terracotta jugs for €5/quarter liter. A full meal runs €25-35 per person. The garden terrace has Val d'Orcia views.

### Osteria Le Logge (Siena) -- Refined Tuscan

Housed in a former 14th-century pharmacy on Via del Porrione, Le Logge is Siena's best restaurant for elevated Tuscan cuisine. The interior retains the original dark-wood pharmacy cabinets, creating a warm, atmospheric setting. Dishes like hand-cut tagliatelle with wild boar ragu (€16), pigeon breast with vin santo reduction (€26), and their extraordinary Chianina beef tartare (€18) showcase premium local ingredients with skilled, restrained preparation. The wine list is a love letter to Tuscany, with over 400 labels. Expect to spend €50-65 per person with wine. Reservations essential.

### La Bottega del Buon Caffe (Florence outskirts) -- Contemporary Tuscan

Just outside Florence's historic center, this Michelin-starred restaurant brings a modern sensibility to Tuscan ingredients. The tasting menu (€95 per person, wine pairing €55) is a journey through the flavors of the region -- from delicate vegetable antipasti grown in the restaurant's own garden to perfectly executed meat and fish courses. The setting is elegant but relaxed, and the service is warm. This is where Tuscan cuisine meets contemporary fine dining without losing its soul. Budget €100-130 per person.

### Antica Osteria da Divo (Siena) -- Unforgettable Setting

What makes Da Divo extraordinary is not just the food but the setting -- you dine in rooms carved from ancient Etruscan tombs beneath the streets of Siena, surrounded by 2,500-year-old stone walls. The cuisine is refined Tuscan with creative touches: truffle-topped dishes in season (€18-25), excellent handmade pasta (€14-18), and well-sourced meat mains (€22-30). The Chianina beef fillet (€28) is consistently outstanding. A full dinner with wine costs about €50-65 per person. The atmosphere is genuinely unique and worth seeking out.

### Dario Cecchini's Restaurants (Panzano in Chianti) -- Legendary Butcher

Dario Cecchini is Italy's most famous butcher, a larger-than-life character who recites Dante while breaking down Chianina beef in his Panzano shop. He operates three dining concepts: **Solociccia** (€30 fixed menu, a multi-course meat feast with no menu -- you eat what Dario decides), **Officina della Bistecca** (€50, centered on the famous bistecca alla fiorentina, communal seating), and **Dario DOC** (burgers and sandwiches from €10 for a quick visit). Solociccia is our pick -- six courses of inventive meat preparations, abundant house wine, and Dario's infectious passion. Book at least two weeks ahead.

## Where to Stay

### Budget: Ostello della Gioventu (Siena) -- From €25/night dorm

Siena's HI hostel occupies a beautiful building near the Stadio Comunale, about 20 minutes' walk from the center. Dorms are clean and well-maintained, with lockers and good showers. There is a basic breakfast included and a communal kitchen. The terrace has views over the Tuscan hills. Private rooms are available from €60/night. The location is quieter than the center, which is actually a benefit after busy days of sightseeing.

### Budget: Agriturismo Podere Salicotto (near Buonconvento) -- From €75/night

This is what Tuscan dreams are made of: a beautifully restored farmhouse surrounded by Val d'Orcia wheat fields, with a pool, home-cooked breakfasts featuring eggs from the property's chickens, and silence broken only by birdsong. Rooms are simple but charming, with terracotta floors, exposed beams, and views that stretch for miles. The Swiss-Italian owners are wonderfully hospitable and full of local recommendations. At €75/night for two, this is extraordinary value for the quality of the experience. Book well ahead.

### Mid-Range: Hotel Palazzo Ravizza (Siena) -- From €130/night

A family-run 3-star hotel in a Renaissance palazzo, steps from Siena's center but with a garden terrace that feels like countryside. Rooms vary in size (ask for one with a view), and the common areas are filled with antiques and family heirlooms. The included breakfast is a proper spread. The garden terrace, with views over the Tuscan hills, is a perfect spot for an evening glass of wine. The family has owned this building for generations and their hospitality is genuine.

### Mid-Range: Borgo San Felice (Chianti) -- From €170/night

A restored medieval hamlet (borgo) converted into a hotel, surrounded by Chianti Classico vineyards. The stone buildings, terracotta roofs, and winding paths create the feeling of a private Tuscan village. Rooms are spacious and elegantly rustic. There is a pool, a spa, and a restaurant using ingredients from the estate's farm and vineyards. Wine tastings at the on-site cantina are included for guests. This is the quintessential Chianti experience at a price that still feels reasonable.

### Luxury: Castello di Casole (Val d'Orcia) -- From €350/night

A 10th-century castle estate covering 4,200 acres of Val d'Orcia countryside, now a Belmond property. Rooms and suites occupy the restored castle and surrounding farmhouses, furnished with Italian antiques and modern luxuries. The infinity pool overlooks an unbroken panorama of Tuscan hills. The restaurant sources almost everything from the estate's own farm. Activities include truffle hunting, private wine tours, horseback riding, and cooking classes. This is Tuscan luxury at its most immersive and authentic. Even at €350/night, it delivers extraordinary value for the caliber of experience.

## When to Visit

**May and June** offer Tuscany at its most vibrant. The countryside is impossibly green, poppies blaze across wheat fields, temperatures are warm but not oppressive (22-28°C), and the long evenings are perfect for al fresco dining. This is the ideal time for driving, hiking, and cycling. Winery visits are uncrowded, and hotels have not yet reached peak pricing.

**September and October** bring the grape harvest (vendemmia), truffle season (tartufi bianchi begin appearing in October), and a golden light that makes the landscape glow. Temperatures cool to a comfortable 18-25°C, summer crowds thin, and the rhythm of rural life becomes visible again as farmers bring in the harvest. Late October adds the olive harvest, and fresh olio nuovo (new olive oil) is a revelation.

**July and August** are hot (regularly above 35°C) and crowded, especially in Florence and Siena. But summer evenings in Tuscany are magical, with outdoor concerts, sagre (food festivals) in small towns, and the Palio in Siena. Air conditioning is not universal in older properties, so choose accommodation carefully.

**November through March** is quiet and atmospheric. Many agriturismos close, but the cities are less crowded and museum visits are more enjoyable. December brings Christmas markets, January has winter truffle season, and the bare winter landscape has a stark, haunting beauty. Budget travelers will find the best prices.

## Getting Around

A **rental car** is essentially mandatory for properly exploring Tuscany beyond the main cities. The countryside -- where the region's greatest beauty, best restaurants, and finest wineries reside -- is largely inaccessible by public transport. Compact cars rent from €35-50/day, and petrol costs about €1.80/liter. GPS is essential, and be warned that many of the most scenic routes are unpaved strade bianche (white roads) -- atmospheric but slow.

**Be extremely careful with ZTL zones** (Zona Traffico Limitato). Most Tuscan city centers are restricted to residents only, enforced by cameras that will automatically photograph your license plate and generate fines of €80-100 each. Your rental car company will forward these fines plus an administrative fee. Never drive into a ZTL zone unless your hotel has arranged a permit for you.

**Trains** connect the major cities effectively: Florence to Siena (1.5 hours, €10), Florence to Arezzo (1 hour, €9-15), and Florence to Pisa (1 hour, €9). But trains do not reach the small hill towns and countryside that define the Tuscan experience.

**Buses** (operated by Tiemme) serve some smaller towns, but schedules can be infrequent, especially on weekends. The Florence-to-San Gimignano bus (via Poggibonsi, about 1.5 hours total, €7) is the most useful route for carless travelers.

<div class="scott-tips">

## Scott's Pro Tips

**Rent a car in Florence, not at the airport.** Airport rental agencies are more expensive and require navigating Florence's confusing ZTL zones to reach the autostrada. City-center rental offices near the Santa Maria Novella train station let you walk in, pick up the car, and head directly out of the city.

**Drive the SP146 from Pienza to San Quirico d'Orcia at golden hour.** This 10-km stretch of road passes through the most photographed landscapes in Tuscany -- the famous Gladiator road with its cypress trees, rolling wheat fields, and distant farmhouses. In late afternoon light, it is almost supernaturally beautiful.

**Visit wineries on weekday mornings.** Weekend afternoons see the biggest crowds, and many smaller producers are closed on weekends entirely. Tuesday through Thursday mornings are ideal -- you will often get personal attention from the winemaker rather than a tour guide.

**Order the bistecca alla fiorentina correctly.** This iconic T-bone steak from Chianina cattle is always served rare (al sangue) -- asking for it well-done is considered sacrilege. It is priced by weight (typically €50-65/kg) and is meant for two people to share. The restaurant should show you the raw steak before cooking. Pair it with a robust Chianti Classico Riserva.

**Base yourself in the countryside, not in Florence.** Florence is magnificent but it is a city experience. The soul of Tuscany is in the countryside. An agriturismo (farm stay) with a pool in the Chianti or Val d'Orcia region, with Florence accessible for day trips, gives you the best of both worlds and is often cheaper than a Florence hotel.

**Learn two words: senza prenotazione (without reservation).** Many of the best trattorias in small Tuscan towns do not take reservations and operate on a first-come basis. Arrive at 12:30 for lunch or 7:30 for dinner to snag a table. If there is a wait, the nonno at the next table will probably offer you a glass of wine while you stand there.

**Buy olive oil directly from producers.** Tuscan extra virgin olive oil is one of the world's finest, and buying it at the source costs a fraction of what you would pay in shops. Most agriturismos and many wineries produce their own oil and are happy to sell bottles (€8-15 per liter). The freshest oil, pressed in November, has a peppery kick that is addictive.

</div>

## Beyond the Highlights

Tuscany rewards exploration off the beaten path. **Arezzo** has Piero della Francesca's extraordinary Legend of the True Cross frescoes in the Basilica di San Francesco (€10, book ahead) and a wonderful antique market on the first Sunday of each month. **Cortona**, the setting of Under the Tuscan Sun, is a steep and atmospheric Etruscan hill town with far fewer tourists than San Gimignano. **Volterra** rivals San Gimignano in medieval character but receives a fraction of the visitors, and its Etruscan museum (€10) houses remarkable artifacts.

The **Crete Senesi** south of Siena is a landscape of clay hills, eroded badlands, and isolated cypress trees that feels almost lunar -- completely different from the green hills of Chianti and just as beautiful. The thermal baths at **Saturnia** (free outdoor cascades, or €30 for the luxury spa) are a memorable detour in southern Tuscany.

And everywhere, there are the small moments that no guidebook can predict: a roadside shrine with fresh flowers, a farmer who waves you over to taste his wine, a sunset that turns the wheat fields to copper and the cypress trees to black silhouettes against a tangerine sky. These are the moments that make Tuscany not just a destination but a state of mind.

## Final Thoughts

We have traveled widely in Italy and across Europe, and Tuscany remains the region to which we most want to return. Not because it offers the most dramatic scenery (the Dolomites and Amalfi Coast have the edge there) or the most vibrant city life (that belongs to Rome and Naples) or even the best food (a claim that would start a fight in Bologna or Sicily). Tuscany draws us back because it offers all of these things in balance, woven together by a landscape and a quality of light that seem to make everything better.

A glass of Brunello tastes better when you drink it on a terrace overlooking the vineyards where the grapes were grown. A plate of pici pasta is more satisfying when you eat it in a vaulted stone room where people have been eating for five hundred years. A sunset is more moving when the hills roll endlessly away in shades of gold and amber, punctuated by dark cypresses that seem to have been placed there by someone who understood beauty at its deepest level.

Tuscany does not rush. It does not shout. It simply is -- beautiful, generous, timeless, and endlessly rewarding for those willing to slow down and pay attention.
