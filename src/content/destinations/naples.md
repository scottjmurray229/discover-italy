  - question: "What is the best time to visit Naples?"
    answer: "The best months to visit Naples are April, May, June, September, and October. Spring brings mild temperatures ideal for walking the dense historic center, while early autumn offers warm days without the oppressive summer heat. July and August are hot and crowded, and many locals leave the city."
  - question: "How much does it cost to visit Naples?"
    answer: "Naples is one of Italy's most affordable major cities. Budget travelers can get by on around €50/day, mid-range visitors should plan for about €130/day, and luxury travelers will spend around €300/day. Street food and pizza are remarkably cheap, and many churches and piazzas are free to explore."
  - question: "Is Naples safe for tourists?"
    answer: "Naples is far safer than its reputation suggests, though awareness matters. Stick to main streets at night, watch for scooter-borne bag snatchers, and keep valuables in front pockets or a crossbody bag. The historic center, waterfront, and Vomero are perfectly safe during the day. Use common sense and you will have no problems."
  - question: "How do I get to Naples?"
    answer: "Fly into Naples International Airport (NAP), which has connections across Europe, or take a high-speed Frecciarossa train — Naples Centrale is roughly 70 minutes from Rome Termini. Ferries connect Naples to Capri, Ischia, Procida, and the Aeolian Islands from Molo Beverello and Porta di Massa."
  - question: "How many days do you need in Naples?"
    answer: "We recommend a minimum of three full days for the city itself. Add a fourth for Pompeii or Herculaneum, a fifth if you want to visit the Amalfi Coast or Capri. A full week lets you explore the city deeply and take multiple day trips without rushing."

# Naples: The Raw, Beautiful Soul of Southern Italy

Naples does not ease you in gently. It hits you the moment you step out of Napoli Centrale station — the wall of noise, the tangle of scooters ignoring every traffic signal, the smell of woodsmoke and fried dough, the crumbling Baroque facades stacked five stories high above streets so narrow that laundry lines connect buildings like stitches holding the city together. It is chaotic, intense, sometimes overwhelming, and absolutely magnificent.

This is not the manicured Italy of Tuscan postcards and Venetian gondolas. Naples is Italy with the volume turned all the way up, a city that has been continuously inhabited for nearly three thousand years and shows every layer of that history in its streets, its walls, and its people. The ancient Greeks founded it as Neapolis — the New City — and since then it has been ruled by Romans, Normans, the French House of Anjou, the Spanish Habsburgs, and the Bourbon dynasty before finally joining a unified Italy in 1861. Every one of those rulers left their mark, and the result is a cityscape of almost absurd density: Greek walls beneath Roman aqueducts beneath medieval churches beneath Baroque palaces, all of it alive and in use.

And then there is Vesuvius. The volcano looms over everything, visible from nearly every rooftop and piazza, a constant reminder that this city exists in a state of beautiful defiance. The same geological forces that destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum created the extraordinarily fertile soil that produces the San Marzano tomatoes and the fior di latte mozzarella that make Neapolitan pizza the best on earth. Naples has always lived in the shadow of catastrophe, and it has responded by becoming the most vibrantly alive city in Italy.

We have returned to Naples more times than any other Italian city, and each visit peels back another layer. The first time, we were honestly rattled by the intensity. By the third visit, we understood: Naples rewards those who surrender to its rhythm rather than trying to impose their own.

## The Historic Center: Three Thousand Years in a Single Walk

### Spaccanapoli — The Street That Splits Naples in Half

The best way to understand Naples is to walk Spaccanapoli, the dead-straight street that cleaves the historic center from west to east along the path of the original Greek road. Its official name changes every few blocks — Via Benedetto Croce, Via San Biagio dei Librai, Via Vicaria Vecchia — but locals simply call it Spaccanapoli, "the street that splits Naples." Standing at the viewpoint on Via San Martino in the Vomero hills above, you can see it slicing through the dense urban fabric like a knife through a block of tufo stone.

Walking Spaccanapoli at street level is a sensory education. Every doorway opens into a different century: a medieval courtyard here, a Baroque church there, a Roman column embedded in a wall that now supports a motorcycle repair shop. Street vendors sell taralli (savory ring-shaped crackers) and roasted chestnuts in winter, sliced coconut and cold water in summer. Shrines to the Madonna are tucked into niches above doorways, sometimes lit by electric candles, sometimes by actual flame. The noise is constant — conversations shouted between balconies, scooter engines, the clatter of espresso cups.

### Naples Underground — The City Beneath the City

Forty meters below the chaos of the streets lies another Naples entirely. Napoli Sotterranea (Naples Underground) takes visitors into the Greek-Roman aqueduct system that supplied water to the city for over two thousand years, through tunnels carved from the soft tufo volcanic stone that underlies the entire city. During World War II, these tunnels served as air-raid shelters for thousands of Neapolitans during Allied bombing campaigns. You can still see the graffiti, the makeshift furniture, and the small shrines they built underground.

The standard guided tour lasts about 90 minutes and costs €12. The entrance is on Via dei Tribunali, near Piazza San Gaetano. The narrowest passage requires squeezing through a gap about 50 centimeters wide while holding a candle — not ideal for the claustrophobic, but genuinely thrilling for everyone else. A separate underground network beneath the Basilica of San Lorenzo Maggiore reveals an entire Roman marketplace, frozen in time beneath the medieval church above.

### San Gregorio Armeno — The Nativity Street

Via San Gregorio Armeno is Naples at its most wonderfully eccentric. This narrow lane connecting Spaccanapoli to Via dei Tribunali is famous worldwide as the street of the presepe — the Neapolitan nativity scene. But these are not ordinary nativities. Neapolitan artisans have been crafting elaborate, hyper-detailed nativity figures here since at least the eighteenth century, and the tradition has evolved to include miniature figures of politicians, footballers, celebrities, and anyone else who captured public attention that year.

The workshops are open year-round, though the street reaches fever pitch from November through January. Master craftsmen like the Ferrigno family have been making figurines for generations, and watching them hand-paint a shepherd's face with a brush containing perhaps three hairs is mesmerizing. Prices range from €5 for a simple figure to several thousand euros for a complete handcrafted scene. Even if you have no intention of buying, walking this street is essential for understanding the particular Neapolitan genius for turning sacred tradition into living art.

### The Duomo and the Miracle of San Gennaro

The Cathedral of Naples, dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, is a fourteenth-century Gothic structure built atop much older foundations. Inside, the Chapel of San Gennaro (the city's patron saint) houses two vials of the saint's dried blood, which — according to tradition and the fervent belief of Neapolitans — liquefies three times a year. The most important liquefaction occurs on September 19th, the saint's feast day, when the Archbishop holds the vial before a packed cathedral and anxious crowds in the piazza outside. If the blood fails to liquefy, Neapolitans consider it a terrible omen.

The Duomo is free to enter. The attached Museo del Tesoro di San Gennaro (Museum of the Treasure of San Gennaro) costs €9 and contains a collection of religious jewelry and precious objects that, in terms of sheer value, is said to rival the British Crown Jewels.

## Museums: World-Class Collections Without the Crowds

### Museo Archeologico Nazionale — The Greatest Roman Collection on Earth

If you visit only one museum in Naples, make it this one. The National Archaeological Museum houses the largest and most important collection of Roman artifacts in the world, including the vast majority of portable finds from Pompeii and Herculaneum. The Farnese Collection occupies the ground floor with colossal Roman marble sculptures, including the Farnese Bull — the largest single sculpture surviving from antiquity — and the Farnese Hercules, whose muscular perfection influenced Renaissance artists for centuries.

Upstairs, the Pompeii galleries display mosaics, frescoes, and everyday objects recovered from the buried cities. The Alexander Mosaic, depicting Alexander the Great battling Darius III of Persia, is breathtaking in its detail and scale. The Secret Cabinet (Gabinetto Segreto), once locked away from public view for centuries due to its erotic content, is now open and provides a surprisingly frank window into Roman attitudes toward sexuality.

Admission is €18 (€2 for EU citizens aged 18-25, free for under 18). The museum is open Wednesday through Monday, 9:00-19:30. Allow at least three hours, ideally more. Visit first thing in the morning to have the major galleries largely to yourself.

### Cappella Sansevero and the Veiled Christ

The Cappella Sansevero is a small chapel that contains what many consider the single greatest sculpture in Italy — and in a country containing Michelangelo's David, that is an extraordinary claim. Giuseppe Sanmartino's Cristo Velato (Veiled Christ), completed in 1753, depicts the dead Christ lying beneath a transparent marble veil so impossibly thin, so perfectly rendered, that visitors routinely gasp upon seeing it. The veil appears to be actual fabric laid over stone. It is not. It is solid marble, carved with a precision that defies comprehension.

The rest of the chapel is equally remarkable: Antonio Corradini's Modesty (a veiled female figure) and Francesco Queirolo's Disillusion (a figure struggling free from a marble net) are masterpieces in their own right. The chapel is tiny and limits visitor numbers. Tickets cost €10 and should be booked online in advance, as the chapel frequently sells out. Allow 30-45 minutes.

### Museo di Capodimonte

Set in a former Bourbon royal palace atop a hill surrounded by parkland, the Museo di Capodimonte holds one of Italy's finest painting collections. Caravaggio, Titian, Raphael, Bellini, Masaccio — the list of masters represented here would be the envy of any museum in the world. Yet because it sits outside the dense historic center, it receives a fraction of the visitors that comparable collections in Florence or Rome attract.

The Caravaggio room alone justifies the trip. The Flagellation of Christ, painted for a Neapolitan church in 1607, is one of his most powerful works — the dramatic chiaroscuro lighting feels like it could burn through the canvas. Admission is €14. The surrounding Bosco di Capodimonte (royal park) is free and perfect for a walk after the intensity of the galleries.

## The Pizza Pilgrimage: Where It All Began

Pizza as the world knows it was born in Naples. Not as a tourist product or an export commodity, but as the food of the Neapolitan poor — flatbread baked in wood-fired ovens and topped with whatever was cheap and available. When Queen Margherita of Savoy visited Naples in 1889, pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito reportedly created a pizza in the colors of the Italian flag — red tomato, white mozzarella, green basil — and named it in her honor. Whether or not that story is entirely true, the Margherita remains the benchmark by which all Neapolitan pizza is judged.

### The Rules of Neapolitan Pizza

True Neapolitan pizza follows strict principles codified by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana. The dough must be hand-stretched (never rolled with a pin), made from Type 00 or Type 0 flour, natural yeast or brewer's yeast, salt, and water. It must be baked in a wood-fired dome oven at roughly 485 degrees Celsius for 60-90 seconds. The result is a soft, pliable crust with a puffy, charred cornicione (rim), a thin center that sags slightly when you lift a slice, and a flavor profile that no other pizza style on earth can replicate.

### Da Michele — The Temple

L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele, on Via Cesare Sersale, has been open since 1870 and serves exactly two types of pizza: Margherita and Marinara. That is it. No menu. No appetizers. No dessert. You sit at a communal table, you order one or both, and you eat what many consider the finest pizza on the planet. A Margherita costs €5. The queue can stretch down the block, but it moves fast — people eat quickly here, not because the experience is rushed, but because the pizza is so good that conversation stops until the last bite is gone. Open Monday-Saturday 11:00-23:00.

### Sorbillo — The Dynasty

Gino Sorbillo represents the third generation of a pizza-making family on Via dei Tribunali. His pizzeria serves a wider range of toppings than Da Michele and offers a slightly more refined dining experience, though the fundamentals remain the same: wood-fired oven, hand-stretched dough, exceptional ingredients. The classic Margherita here costs €5-6, while specialty pizzas with seasonal toppings run €8-12. The queue is long, especially on weekends. Open daily 12:00-15:30 and 19:00-23:30.

### Di Matteo — The Street-Side Legend

Also on Via dei Tribunali, Di Matteo is famous for two things: excellent sit-down pizza and its fried pizza window. The pizza fritta — a folded pocket of dough stuffed with ricotta, provola, and cicoli (pork cracklings), then deep-fried — is a Naples street food institution. You can grab one from the takeaway window for €2-3 and eat it standing on the sidewalk. Bill Clinton famously ate one here during the 1994 G7 summit. Inside, a full pizza starts at €4.

### 50 Kalo — The Modern Master

Ciro Salvo's 50 Kalo, in the Mergellina area near the waterfront, represents the evolution of Neapolitan pizza into something that honors tradition while pushing quality to new heights. The dough is fermented for longer than most pizzerias allow, resulting in an exceptionally light and digestible crust. The ingredients are sourced with obsessive care. A Margherita costs €7, and specialty creations run €10-14. This is where to go if you want to taste where Neapolitan pizza is heading. Reservations recommended.

### Pizza Fritta — The People's Pizza

Do not leave Naples without eating pizza fritta. This deep-fried pizza — essentially a calzone submerged in boiling oil — was historically the cheapest way to eat pizza, since frying required less fuel than firing a full oven. Today it persists as one of the city's great street foods. You will find it at Di Matteo, at Zia Esterina Sorbillo (Gino Sorbillo's aunt, who runs a dedicated friggitoria on Via dei Tribunali), and at countless small shops in the Quartieri Spagnoli. Expect to pay €2-4. Eat it hot, ideally while walking.

## Food Beyond Pizza: The Neapolitan Table

Naples is far more than pizza, though you could be forgiven for never discovering that fact if you spend your entire visit eating Margheritas. The city's culinary tradition is rooted in what Italians call cucina povera — the cuisine of poverty — which transforms humble ingredients into dishes of extraordinary depth through patience, technique, and the quality of Campanian produce.

### Sfogliatella — The Pastry That Defines Naples

The sfogliatella is to Naples what the croissant is to Paris — the essential morning pastry, the non-negotiable start to the day. It comes in two forms: sfogliatella riccia (the crispy, shell-shaped version with dozens of paper-thin layers of dough) and sfogliatella frolla (a smoother, shortcrust version). Both are filled with a mixture of ricotta, semolina, candied citrus peel, and a whisper of cinnamon. The riccia is the more traditional and the more difficult to make — each layer must be individually stretched and brushed with lard before baking.

The finest sfogliatelle in Naples come from Pintauro on Via Toledo (operating since 1785, €2.50 each) and Attanasio near the central train station (€1.80 each, and they come out of the oven every few minutes — eat one still warm and your life will change slightly).

### Baba — Soaked in Rum, Soaked in History

The baba (or baba au rhum) arrived in Naples via France, but Neapolitans adopted it so thoroughly that it is now considered a local institution. A small, mushroom-shaped yeast cake is soaked in rum syrup until it is heavy and glistening, then served plain or filled with pastry cream and fresh berries. A good baba should be saturated enough that a gentle squeeze releases syrup, but not so soaked that the cake loses its structure. Scaturchio in Piazza San Domenico Maggiore (€3) and Gran Caffe Gambrinus on Piazza del Plebiscito (€4.50) both serve exemplary versions.

### Ragu Napoletano — The Sunday Sauce

Neapolitan ragu is not Bolognese ragu. Where the Bolognese version is a meat-based sauce of ground beef and pork cooked for hours, ragu napoletano is built around large pieces of meat — typically beef braciole (rolled and stuffed meat), pork ribs, and sausages — slow-cooked in tomato sauce for anywhere from four to eight hours until the meat falls apart and the sauce achieves a dark, concentrated sweetness. The sauce is served with pasta (typically ziti or paccheri), and the meat is served separately as a second course. This is the Sunday dish of Naples, the meal that families gather around, and getting an invitation to share it in a Neapolitan home is one of the great privileges of travel.

In restaurants, look for ragu napoletano at Tandem (Via Giovanni Paladino, €10-12 for a generous plate) and Nennella in the Quartieri Spagnoli (€8-10, expect theatrical service and communal tables).

### Mozzarella di Bufala and the Pignasecca Market

The Pignasecca market, near the Montesanto funicular station, is the oldest continuously operating street market in Naples. It is not prettified for tourists — this is where Neapolitans from the surrounding Quartieri Spagnoli neighborhoods do their daily shopping. Fish vendors shout prices over beds of ice piled with local catch, fruit sellers stack crates of Vesuvian apricots and lemons the size of softballs, and at several stalls you can buy mozzarella di bufala that was made that morning in Caserta or Paestum.

Eat the mozzarella within hours of buying it, at room temperature, with nothing more than a pinch of salt and perhaps a drizzle of olive oil. This is one of the purest food experiences in Italy — the rich, milky sweetness of fresh buffalo mozzarella bears almost no resemblance to the vacuum-packed product sold abroad. Budget €3-5 for a single ball that will serve two as a generous appetizer.

## Neighborhoods: The Many Faces of Naples

### Vomero — The Elegant Hilltop

Take the Chiaia or Montesanto funicular up to Vomero and the city transforms. Wide boulevards, Liberty-style architecture, well-dressed shoppers, and an atmosphere of bourgeois calm that feels like a different city entirely. The Certosa di San Martino, a former Carthusian monastery converted into a museum, offers perhaps the finest view in Naples from its cloister gardens — the entire bay spread before you, with Vesuvius presiding over it all. The Castel Sant'Elmo next door (€6) provides a 360-degree panorama from its star-shaped ramparts.

### Sanita — The Resurrection

The Rione Sanita, tucked in a valley below Capodimonte, was for decades one of Naples' most neglected neighborhoods — a place guidebooks warned tourists away from. In recent years, a remarkable community-led revival has transformed Sanita into one of the most exciting neighborhoods in the city. Father Antonio Loffredo of the local basilica organized young people to open the Catacombs of San Gennaro to tourism (guided tours €12, absolutely worth it), and the revenue has funded cooperatives, workshops, and social enterprises throughout the neighborhood.

Today, Sanita offers some of the most authentic and affordable food in Naples, street art that rivals Shoreditch or Bushwick, and a genuine sense of community that you will not find in the tourist center. Walk here with an open mind and reasonable awareness, and you will discover a Naples that most visitors never see.

### Chiaia and the Waterfront

Chiaia is Naples' most elegant neighborhood, stretching from Piazza dei Martiri down to the waterfront lungomare. Via Chiaia and Via dei Mille are the city's premier shopping streets, lined with Italian and international fashion houses. The Villa Comunale, a long waterfront park, provides shaded walks with views across the bay, and the Lungomare Caracciolo — the seafront promenade — is where all of Naples comes to passeggiata (evening stroll) as the sun sets behind Posillipo.

For the best waterfront dining experience, walk out along the breakwater to Castel dell'Ovo, the oldest castle in Naples, built on the tiny island of Megaride where the original Greek settlers first landed. The restaurants in the Borgo Marinari at the castle's base serve fresh seafood at reasonable prices (expect €25-40 per person for a full fish dinner with wine), and the views of Vesuvius across the bay at sunset are the kind of thing that makes you understand why people fall in love with this city and never fully recover.

### Quartieri Spagnoli — The Authentic Heart

The Spanish Quarters, a tight grid of narrow streets climbing steeply uphill from Via Toledo, were originally built in the sixteenth century to house Spanish military garrisons. Today they are among the most densely populated and atmospherically intense neighborhoods in Europe. Laundry hangs between buildings, elderly women sit in doorways, scooters thread through streets barely wide enough for a single car, and shrines to Diego Maradona share wall space with images of the Madonna.

This is not a neighborhood to fear. Walk through during the day with a reasonable awareness of your belongings and you will find incredible street food (friggitorie selling cuoppo — paper cones filled with fried seafood and vegetables for €3-5), authentic trattorie where a full lunch costs €10-15, and a sense of Neapolitan daily life that no museum or monument can replicate.

## Day Trips: The Riches of the Bay

### Pompeii and Herculaneum

The twin buried cities are among the most extraordinary archaeological sites on earth. Pompeii, the larger site, requires at least three to four hours and ideally a full day. Herculaneum (Ercolano), smaller but better preserved — the volcanic mud that buried it carbonized wood and preserved organic materials that Pompeii's ash did not — can be explored in two to three hours. If you only have time for one, Herculaneum offers a more intimate and less overwhelming experience. If you have time for both, do Herculaneum in the morning and Pompeii in the afternoon.

Both sites are reached via the Circumvesuviana train from Napoli Centrale (approximately €3-4 each way, 30-40 minutes). Pompeii admission is €18; Herculaneum is €13. A combined ticket covering five sites over three days costs €22 and is excellent value. Bring water, sunscreen, and comfortable shoes — there is little shade at either site.

### The Amalfi Coast

Positano, Amalfi, and Ravello are all reachable as day trips from Naples, though the journey itself is part of the experience and the challenge. The SITA bus from Sorrento along the coast road is scenic but slow and crowded in summer. Ferries from Naples' Molo Beverello to Positano and Amalfi (€15-25 each way, seasonal) are faster and more pleasant. If budget allows, hire a private car for the day (€200-300) to stop at viewpoints and avoid the bus queues.

### Capri and Procida

Ferries to Capri depart frequently from Molo Beverello (fast ferry €22 each way, 50 minutes; slower ferry €15, 80 minutes). Capri is beautiful but expensive and crowded in summer — consider visiting in shoulder season. For a far less touristy island experience, take the ferry to Procida (€15 each way, 35 minutes), which gained international attention as the setting for the 2022 film "The Hand of God" and as Italian Capital of Culture. Procida's pastel-colored fishermen's houses stacked above the Marina Corricella may be the most photogenic scene in the Bay of Naples.

## Practical Tips for Navigating Naples

<div class="scott-tips">

### Scott's Tips for Naples

**Understand the safety reality.** Naples' reputation as dangerous is outdated but not entirely unfounded. Petty theft — particularly bag-snatching by thieves on scooters — does happen. Wear a crossbody bag with the strap across your chest, keep your phone in your front pocket, and avoid displaying expensive jewelry. The historic center, waterfront, and major tourist areas are safe during the day. At night, stick to well-lit streets with foot traffic and avoid the area immediately around the train station. Use the same common sense you would in any major European city and you will be fine.

**Do not even think about driving.** Naples traffic is a system that operates on rules invisible to outsiders. Lanes are suggestions. Red lights are advisory. Scooters emerge from directions that should not be physically possible. The only appropriate response is to leave the car at the airport, take the train or metro into the city, and walk. The centro storico is largely pedestrianized anyway, and walking is by far the best way to experience the city. If you must reach the Amalfi Coast, hire a driver rather than renting a car yourself.

**Master the Circumvesuviana.** This commuter rail line is your lifeline to Pompeii (Pompei Scavi-Villa dei Misteri stop), Herculaneum (Ercolano Scavi stop), and Sorrento. Trains run every 20-30 minutes from the lower level of Napoli Centrale. Buy tickets from the station booth or machines before boarding. The trains are old, often crowded, and not air-conditioned — but they work, they are cheap (€3-4 to Pompeii), and they go exactly where you need to go. Keep an eye on your belongings on board.

**Buy the Campania ArteCard.** The 3-day Regional ArteCard (€40) covers free entry to the first two museums or sites, then 50% off all others, plus unlimited transport on buses, metro, and the Circumvesuviana throughout Campania. Given that the Archaeological Museum alone is €18, and Pompeii is another €18, the card pays for itself with your first two visits. Purchase it at the airport, train station, or any participating museum.

**Watch for pickpockets on public transport.** The metro Line 1 and the Circumvesuviana are the two places where pickpocket risk is highest. Keep bags zipped and in front of you, do not put your phone in your back pocket, and be especially alert when trains are crowded and at station stops where the doors open. This is not unique to Naples — the same advice applies in Rome, Barcelona, and Paris — but it bears repeating.

**Get the best views from Castel dell'Ovo.** Walk out to Castel dell'Ovo on the Megaride island at sunset. The views of Vesuvius across the bay, the Lungomare stretching in both directions, and the city climbing the hills behind you are the defining panorama of Naples. Entry to the castle terrace is free. The Borgo Marinari restaurants at the castle base are touristy but pleasant for an aperitivo with a view — expect €8-12 for a spritz.

**Eat early or eat late.** Neapolitan lunch service typically runs 12:30-15:00, and dinner service 19:30-23:00. Arriving at popular pizzerias like Da Michele or Sorbillo at 12:00 or 19:00 — before the main rush — dramatically reduces your queue time. Alternatively, embracing the late Neapolitan dinner hour (arriving at 21:00 or later) means shorter waits and a more relaxed atmosphere.

## Getting Around Naples

Naples' metro system is small but useful. Line 1 connects the train station (Garibaldi) to the historic center (Toledo, Dante, Museo) and up to Vomero (Vanvitelli). The Toledo station, designed by Oscar Tusquets Blanca, is regularly cited as one of the most beautiful metro stations in Europe — the descent through blue mosaic walls feels like sinking into the Mediterranean. A single ticket costs €1.30 and is valid for 90 minutes on all buses and metro lines. A daily pass costs €4.50.

Three funicular railways connect the lower city to the Vomero hill: the Funicolare Centrale from Via Toledo, the Funicolare di Chiaia from Parco Margherita, and the Funicolare di Montesanto from Piazza Montesanto. All accept the same metro tickets.

Taxis in Naples use meters but always confirm before departure. A ride from the airport to the city center should cost approximately €19-23 (there is a fixed tariff). From the train station to the waterfront, expect €8-12. The Alibus shuttle connects the airport to the city center and train station (€5, every 15-20 minutes).

## How Many Days Do You Need in Naples?

Three days is the minimum for the city itself — one for the historic center and Spaccanapoli, one for the Archaeological Museum and Cappella Sansevero, and one for the waterfront, Vomero, and deeper neighborhood exploration. If you want to include Pompeii, add a fourth day. For the Amalfi Coast or Capri, add a fifth. A full week in and around Naples is easy to fill and never feels like too much.

What we have learned from multiple visits is that Naples is not a city to check off a list. It is a city to inhabit, even briefly. Slow down. Eat a second sfogliatella. Sit in a piazza and watch the theater of daily life unfold around you. Get lost in the Quartieri Spagnoli and find your way out by following the smell of ragu. The guidebook Naples and the real Naples are two different cities, and the real one is infinitely better.

## Final Thoughts

Naples is the most honest city in Italy. It does not dress itself up for visitors, does not hide its contradictions behind a freshly painted facade. The grandeur and the grit exist side by side — a Caravaggio masterpiece in a museum next to a crumbling palazzo, a Michelin-starred restaurant around the corner from a €3 pizza fritta stand, a Roman ruin beneath a living apartment building. This is what makes it extraordinary. This is what makes it, for many travelers who give it a real chance, the most unforgettable city in the country.

Come to Naples with your eyes open and your expectations flexible. Leave room for surprise, for discomfort, for the kind of raw beauty that only exists in places that have not been sanitized for tourist consumption. And eat the pizza. Eat all the pizza. You are in the place where it was invented, and nothing will ever taste quite this good again.
