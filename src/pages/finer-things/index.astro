      { label: 'Chianti Classico', text: 'The iconic Tuscan red — Sangiovese-based, medium-bodied, with cherry, leather, and earthy notes. A bottle of Chianti Classico DOCG runs <strong>€12–25</strong> at an enoteca (wine shop) and <strong>€6–10 per glass</strong> at a trattoria in Florence or Siena. Look for the black rooster (<em>Gallo Nero</em>) seal — it means it\'s from the original Classico zone between Florence and Siena. The Riserva (aged 24+ months) is worth the extra €5–10 per bottle.' },
      { label: 'Barolo', text: 'The "King of Wines" from Piedmont — Nebbiolo grapes, full-bodied, tannic, with notes of tar, roses, and dried cherry. A good bottle starts at <strong>€25–40</strong> in the Langhe region and climbs from there. By-the-glass in Alba or Turin, expect <strong>€10–18</strong>. Barolo needs food — pair it with braised beef, truffled tajarin pasta, or aged cheeses. If Barolo is too intense, try <strong>Barbaresco</strong> — same grape, slightly more approachable, often €5–10 less per bottle.' },
      { label: 'Prosecco', text: 'Italy\'s sparkling wine from the Veneto — light, fresh, with green apple and pear notes. A bottle of Prosecco DOC runs <strong>€6–12</strong> at a shop and <strong>€4–7 per glass</strong> at a bar. The step up is <strong>Prosecco Superiore DOCG</strong> from the Valdobbiadene hills — more complex and worth every cent. It\'s the base for an Aperol Spritz, but don\'t sleep on it straight — cold Prosecco on a terrace overlooking the Venetian canals is one of Italy\'s best simple pleasures.' },
      { label: 'Amarone della Valpolicella', text: 'A rich, velvety red from Veneto made with partially dried grapes — concentrated flavors of dark cherry, chocolate, and spice. Bottles start at <strong>€25–50</strong> at a shop in Verona. It\'s a special-occasion wine even for Italians. If the price is steep, try <strong>Valpolicella Ripasso</strong> — made using Amarone\'s leftover grape skins, giving it similar richness at <strong>€12–20</strong> per bottle. The locals call it "baby Amarone" and it\'s an outstanding value.' },
      { label: 'Super Tuscans', text: 'Born in the 1970s when rebellious Tuscan winemakers blended Sangiovese with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot — breaking DOC rules to make world-class wine. <strong>Sassicaia</strong>, <strong>Tignanello</strong>, and <strong>Ornellaia</strong> are the legends, running <strong>€80–300+</strong> per bottle. But lesser-known Super Tuscans from Bolgheri and Maremma start at <strong>€15–30</strong> and deliver exceptional quality. Ask any enoteca owner for their favorite — they love this question.' },
      { label: 'How Italians Actually Drink Wine', text: 'Wine is food in Italy — it accompanies meals, not replaces them. <strong>House wine</strong> (<em>vino della casa</em>) at a trattoria runs <strong>€3–6 per quarter liter</strong> and is almost always good. Italians rarely order by the bottle at casual meals — a <em>quartino</em> or <em>mezzo litro</em> (half liter) is normal. White with fish and seafood, red with meat and pasta — but locals won\'t judge you for breaking the rules. The real sin is ordering a cappuccino after a meal. Wine is the only proper post-dinner drink (or a digestivo).' },

      { label: 'The Aperol Spritz', text: 'Italy\'s unofficial national drink — Aperol, Prosecco, and a splash of soda over ice with an orange slice. <strong>€4–8</strong> depending on the city and neighborhood. In Venice, the birthplace of the Spritz, you\'ll pay €3–4 standing at a <em>bacaro</em> (wine bar) or €7–10 seated in Piazza San Marco. In Milan\'s Navigli district, the drink comes with a full spread of free snacks. It\'s bitter, it\'s refreshing, and after your third one you\'ll understand why Italy invented the concept of drinking before dinner.' },
      { label: 'The Negroni', text: 'Equal parts gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth — stirred, not shaken, served on the rocks with an orange peel. Invented in Florence in 1919, allegedly by Count Camillo Negroni. <strong>€7–12</strong> at a good cocktail bar. The <strong>Negroni Sbagliato</strong> swaps gin for Prosecco and is lighter, more effervescent — perfect for a hot afternoon. For the best Negroni in Florence, try <strong>Caffe Rivoire</strong> in Piazza della Signoria or any bar on the Oltrarno side of the Arno.' },
      { label: 'Campari Soda', text: 'The simplest Italian aperitivo — Campari over ice topped with soda water. <strong>€3–5</strong> almost everywhere. It\'s bitter, bright red, and an acquired taste — but once you acquire it, nothing else scratches the same itch. The iconic single-serve Campari Soda bottles (designed by Fortunato Depero in 1932) are a piece of Italian design history and cost about <strong>€2</strong> at a bar. Order one and you\'ll look like you\'ve been drinking in Italy for years.' },
      { label: 'Where to Drink Aperitivo', text: '<strong>Milan</strong> takes aperitivo most seriously — bars along the Navigli canals and in Brera offer free buffet-style food spreads with any drink order from 6–9pm. <strong>Venice</strong> has the <em>bacari</em> crawl — hopping between tiny wine bars for <em>cicchetti</em> (small bites) and <em>ombre</em> (small glasses of wine). <strong>Turin</strong> invented the vermouth tradition and still does it best at historic cafes like <strong>Caffe Al Bicerin</strong>. <strong>Rome\'s</strong> Trastevere and Monti neighborhoods have the most character for evening drinks.' },
      { label: 'Aperitivo Etiquette', text: 'Aperitivo runs from roughly <strong>6pm to 9pm</strong> — it\'s the bridge between work and dinner. Some bars include free snacks with your drink order (especially in Milan), while others charge separately. <strong>Don\'t treat the free food spread as dinner</strong> — Italians consider that poor form, even though the spread is often generous enough to be a meal. One or two drinks is standard. Aperitivo is meant to stimulate your appetite, not replace your meal. Dress smart-casual — Italians notice.' },
      { label: 'The Cost of Aperitivo', text: 'A typical aperitivo evening: one Spritz or Negroni (<strong>€5–10</strong>) plus a small plate of snacks or free buffet access. Total cost for a great pre-dinner ritual: <strong>€5–15 per person</strong>. Compare that to a cocktail in New York or London and you\'ll understand why aperitivo hour is one of the best values in European travel. In smaller towns and southern Italy, prices drop further — a Spritz for €3 with a view of the Mediterranean is entirely possible.' },

      { label: 'Espresso Rules', text: 'An espresso (<em>un caffe</em>) at the bar costs <strong>€1–1.50</strong> across most of Italy — it\'s price-regulated in many cities. You drink it standing at the counter (<em>al banco</em>), knock it back in two or three sips, and move on. Sitting at a table costs more — sometimes double. This isn\'t a rip-off; it\'s how Italian bars work. The surcharge is for the table service. If you want to save money and drink like a local, stand at the bar every time.' },
      { label: 'Cappuccino Etiquette', text: 'Italians drink cappuccino <strong>only in the morning</strong>, typically before 11am. Ordering one after lunch or dinner will mark you as a tourist faster than anything else. The reasoning: milk after a meal disrupts digestion (or so they believe). Nobody will refuse to make you one — but they\'ll notice. A <em>caffe macchiato</em> (espresso "stained" with a drop of milk) is the acceptable afternoon compromise. <strong>€1.50–2.50</strong> for a cappuccino, <strong>€1.20–1.80</strong> for a macchiato.' },
      { label: 'Best Coffee Roasters & Bars', text: '<strong>Naples</strong> is the coffee capital — try a <em>caffe sospeso</em> ("suspended coffee," where you pay for an extra one left for someone who can\'t afford it) at <strong>Caffe Gambrinus</strong>. <strong>Turin</strong> has <strong>Lavazza</strong>\'s flagship museum and cafe. <strong>Trieste</strong> is home to <strong>Illy</strong> and has the highest per-capita coffee consumption in Italy. In Florence, <strong>Ditta Artigianale</strong> bridges traditional Italian coffee with third-wave specialty roasting. In Rome, <strong>Sant\'Eustachio Il Caffe</strong> near the Pantheon makes arguably the best espresso in the city.' },
      { label: 'Beyond Espresso', text: 'The Italian coffee menu: <strong>Ristretto</strong> — a more concentrated espresso. <strong>Lungo</strong> — a longer pull, more water. <strong>Caffe corretto</strong> — espresso "corrected" with a shot of grappa, sambuca, or brandy (usually an after-dinner move). <strong>Caffe shakerato</strong> — espresso shaken with ice and sometimes sugar, served in a cocktail glass (perfect for summer). <strong>Marocchino</strong> — espresso, cocoa, and frothed milk in a small glass, popular in Piedmont. Each costs <strong>€1.50–3</strong>.' },
      { label: 'The Starbucks Question', text: 'Starbucks opened its first Italian location in Milan in 2018 — a Reserve Roastery on Piazza Cordusio. It\'s a beautiful space and worth visiting as a spectacle. But don\'t go there for your daily coffee. Italian bars serve better espresso for a fraction of the price. The Italians who do visit Starbucks go for the novelty and the pastries, not because they think the coffee is better. When in Italy, drink coffee the Italian way — fast, strong, and cheap.' },
      { label: 'Coffee Prices at a Glance', text: '<strong>Espresso al banco:</strong> €1–1.50. <strong>Espresso seated:</strong> €2–4 (more at tourist spots like Piazza San Marco in Venice — up to €6–8). <strong>Cappuccino:</strong> €1.50–2.50. <strong>Caffe shakerato:</strong> €2.50–4. <strong>Caffe corretto:</strong> €1.50–2.50. The golden rule: the closer you are to a major monument, the more you pay. Walk two blocks from any tourist piazza and prices drop by half.' },

For cocktails, <strong>Brera</strong> has upscale speakeasies and wine bars. After midnight, clubs like <strong>Alcatraz</strong> and <strong>Fabrique</strong> run until 5am. Milan dresses up — sneakers and shorts will get you turned away at the door.' },
      { label: 'Rome: Trastevere & Testaccio', link: '/destinations/rome/', text: '<strong>Trastevere</strong> is the heart of Roman nightlife — cobblestone streets packed with wine bars, live music, and outdoor seating that spills into the piazzas. Start at <strong>Freni e Frizioni</strong> for aperitivo, then wander. <strong>Testaccio</strong> is where Romans go clubbing — <strong>Goa Club</strong> and <strong>Alibi</strong> are the big names. For a more refined evening, the rooftop bar at <strong>Hotel Minerva</strong> overlooking the Pantheon is unforgettable. Expect to spend <strong>€8–15</strong> per cocktail in Rome\'s better bars.' },
      { label: 'Florence: Oltrarno & Santo Spirito', link: '/destinations/florence/', text: '<strong>Piazza Santo Spirito</strong> in the Oltrarno is Florence\'s living room after dark — locals sit on the church steps with wine while bars buzz around the square. <strong>Volume</strong>, <strong>Rasputin</strong>, and <strong>Mad Souls & Spirits</strong> serve creative cocktails. Florence isn\'t a late-night city — most bars wind down by 1–2am. But the quality of the evening more than makes up for the early bedtime. Pair your drinks with a <em>lampredotto</em> sandwich from a street cart.' },
      { label: 'Naples: Centro Storico', link: '/destinations/naples/', text: 'Naples comes alive after dark with a raw, authentic energy. The <strong>Centro Storico</strong> (historic center) and <strong>Piazza Bellini</strong> are the hubs — cheap beer, loud conversation, and a student-heavy crowd. <strong>Barril</strong> and <strong>Keste</strong> are local favorites. Naples nightlife is unpretentious and loud — the antithesis of Milan\'s polished scene. Drinks are cheaper here than anywhere in northern Italy: <strong>€3–5</strong> for a beer, <strong>€5–8</strong> for a cocktail.' },
      { label: 'Venice: Bacaro Crawl', link: '/destinations/venice/', text: 'Venice doesn\'t do clubs — it does <em>bacari</em>. A <strong>bacaro crawl</strong> (Venetian bar hop) is the way to spend an evening: stand at a tiny counter, order an <em>ombra</em> (small glass of wine, <strong>€2–3</strong>) and a couple of <em>cicchetti</em> (small bites, <strong>€1–3 each</strong>), then move to the next one. Start at <strong>Cantina Do Spade</strong> or <strong>Al Merca</strong> near the Rialto. Four or five stops, you\'ve had a full evening of food and wine for under <strong>€25</strong>.' },
      { label: 'Aperitivo Hour Everywhere', text: 'No matter where you are in Italy, the hours between 6pm and 9pm are sacred. Every town, every city, every village has some version of the pre-dinner drink ritual. In the south, it\'s more casual — a beer on a piazza bench. In the north, it\'s curated spreads and craft cocktails. The universal constant: Italians don\'t eat dinner before 8pm (often 9pm), so aperitivo fills the gap. Embrace the slow pace — rushing through aperitivo defeats the purpose.' },

A bottle of quality limoncello runs <strong>€8–15</strong> at a shop in Sorrento or Amalfi. It\'s served everywhere as a complimentary digestivo at the end of a meal. The homemade (<em>fatto in casa</em>) versions at family-run trattorias are usually the best. Avoid the neon-yellow tourist bottles — real limoncello uses <strong>Sorrento lemons</strong> (sfusato amalfitano) and has a deeper, more complex flavor.' },
      { label: 'Grappa', text: 'Distilled from grape pomace (the skins, seeds, and stems left after winemaking), grappa ranges from harsh firewater to elegant sipping spirit depending on quality. A basic grappa costs <strong>€10–15</strong> per bottle; aged grappas (<em>grappa invecchiata</em> or <em>riserva</em>) from producers like <strong>Nonino</strong>, <strong>Poli</strong>, and <strong>Nardini</strong> run <strong>€25–80+</strong>. In the Veneto and Trentino regions, grappa is an after-dinner institution. Try a <em>grappa di Moscato</em> for something fragrant and approachable, or a <em>grappa di Barolo</em> for depth and complexity.' },
      { label: 'Amaro', text: 'Italy\'s herbal bitter liqueurs — every region has its own. <strong>Amaro Montenegro</strong> (Bologna) is smooth and balanced. <strong>Averna</strong> (Sicily) is bittersweet with citrus and herbs. <strong>Fernet-Branca</strong> (Milan) is intensely bitter and medicinal — an acquired taste that Italians swear settles the stomach. <strong>Amaro Lucano</strong> (Basilicata) and <strong>Amaro del Capo</strong> (Calabria) are southern favorites. A glass costs <strong>€3–5</strong> after dinner. Collect a few favorites and bring bottles home — they\'re affordable and make excellent gifts.' },
      { label: 'Sambuca', text: 'An anise-flavored liqueur traditionally served <em>con la mosca</em> — "with the fly," meaning three coffee beans floating on top (representing health, happiness, and prosperity). Light the beans on fire, blow it out, and sip. It\'s theatrical and fun. A shot costs <strong>€3–5</strong>. <strong>Sambuca Molinari</strong> is the classic brand. In Rome and the south, you\'ll find it served after dinner alongside espresso. It\'s sweet and strong — one is usually enough.' },
      { label: 'Regional Specialties', text: '<strong>Mirto</strong> from Sardinia — a myrtle berry liqueur, red or white, served cold. <strong>Strega</strong> from Benevento — a saffron-yellow herbal liqueur with 70+ botanicals. <strong>Nocino</strong> from Emilia-Romagna — walnut liqueur made from green walnuts harvested on June 24 (St. John\'s Day). <strong>Amaretto di Saronno</strong> — almond-flavored, smooth and sweet, the most internationally famous Italian liqueur. Each region guards its recipe fiercely. Ask your server for the local digestivo — you\'ll often get something you won\'t find outside that town.' },
      { label: 'The Digestivo Ritual', text: 'After dinner, the waiter will ask <em>"un digestivo?"</em> — and you should say yes. It\'s a limoncello, an amaro, a grappa, or whatever the house specialty is. Often it\'s complimentary (included with dinner), especially at family-run restaurants. If not, it\'s <strong>€3–6</strong>. This is a non-negotiable Italian ritual — dinner isn\'t over until the digestivo is finished. Sip slowly. It\'s the final punctuation mark on a meal, and rushing it is the one thing that will genuinely disappoint your Italian hosts.' },

        <p>Italian drinking culture is not about getting drunk — it's about slowing down. An espresso standing at the bar in the morning, a glass of house wine with lunch, aperitivo at sunset with a Spritz or Negroni, then a digestivo after dinner. Every drink has its place and its time. I've traveled through wine regions across France, Spain, and California, and nothing matches the everyday accessibility of great wine and spirits in Italy. A €4 glass of Chianti at a random trattoria in Tuscany would cost $15 back home — and it's usually better. The best part? The ritual. Italians don't just drink; they celebrate every glass.</p>

        <div class="scott-tips">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Aperitivo Strategy:</strong> Milan's Navigli district has the best aperitivo deals in Italy — one drink (€6–10) gets you access to a full buffet spread that can easily serve as dinner. Arrive by 6:30pm for the best selection. In Venice, skip the tourist bars on Piazza San Marco and do a bacaro crawl in Cannaregio instead.</li>
            <li><strong>Coffee Savings:</strong> Always drink your espresso standing at the bar (al banco). Sitting at a table can double or triple the price — especially in tourist areas. A €1.20 espresso at the bar becomes €4–6 at a table in Piazza Navona. Same coffee, different price.</li>
            <li><strong>Wine Shopping:</strong> Buy wine at an enoteca (wine shop) or directly from producers if you're in wine country. Supermarkets also carry excellent wines for €5–15 that would cost $30+ in the US. For bringing bottles home, pack them in your checked luggage wrapped in clothes or use wine bottle protectors.</li>
            <li><strong>Nightlife Safety:</strong> Italian cities are generally safe at night, but watch for pickpockets in crowded nightlife areas — especially in Rome's Trastevere, Naples' Centro Storico, and Milan's Navigli. Use licensed taxis or ride apps. Never leave drinks unattended.</li>
            <li><strong>Tipping at Bars:</strong> Tipping is not expected in Italy. Some places add a coperto (cover charge) of €1–3 per person. At a cocktail bar, rounding up is generous. Don't tip like you're in the US — it confuses bartenders and can come across as patronizing.</li>
            <li><strong>Best Value Evening:</strong> A quartino of house wine (€3–5) with a plate of bruschette or crostini (€4–8) at a neighborhood enoteca. Total: €7–13 for a genuine Italian evening. Add a digestivo (often complimentary) and you've had a complete Italian drinking experience for the price of a single cocktail in New York.</li>
            <li><strong>Bringing Wine Home:</strong> US customs allows 1 liter duty-free per person, but you can bring more and pay a small duty (usually $1–3 per additional bottle). Pack wine in the center of your checked bag wrapped in clothes, or use padded wine travel bags designed for checked luggage. We've brought back dozens of bottles this way with zero breakage.</li>
