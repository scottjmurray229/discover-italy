      { label: 'ATM Strategy', text: 'Use bank ATMs (Bancomat) attached to major banks like Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, or Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. Avoid standalone ATMs in tourist areas — they charge 3-5 EUR fees and terrible exchange rates. Always choose "withdraw without conversion" to avoid dynamic currency conversion markups.' },

They\'re slower but go everywhere — perfect for reaching hill towns and coastal villages. Tickets are cheap (3-15 EUR) and can often be bought same-day. Validate paper tickets before boarding.' },
      { label: 'Buses', text: 'FlixBus and Marino cover long-distance routes between cities, often cheaper than trains. For rural areas and hill towns (Tuscany, Umbria, Amalfi Coast), local SITA or Cotral buses are essential. The Amalfi Coast bus is an experience in itself — stunning views, terrifying hairpins.' },

Book ahead in summer — Tirrenia, Moby, GNV, and SNAV are the major operators.' },

An international driving permit (IDP) is technically required for non-EU licenses. ZTL zones (limited traffic zones) in city centers will trigger automatic fines if you drive in. Stick to manual transmission — automatics cost significantly more.' },
      { label: 'City Transport & Taxis', text: 'Rome, Milan, Naples, and Turin have metro systems. Buses and trams serve all major cities. Buy tickets before boarding at tabacchi shops or machines.

Bring your passport — it\'s required for SIM registration.' },

      { label: 'WiFi Availability', text: 'Free WiFi is available at most hotels, many cafes, and some public spaces. Italian WiFi can be slower than what you\'re used to — 10-30 Mbps is typical. Train stations and airports have free WiFi (often time-limited). Having mobile data as backup is recommended.' },

      { label: 'Hospitals & Pharmacies', text: 'Italy has excellent hospitals (ospedali) in every major city. In emergencies, call 118 for an ambulance. Pharmacies (farmacie, marked with a green cross) can dispense many medications without a prescription and provide basic medical advice. Rotation schedules ensure at least one pharmacy is open 24/7 in each area.' },
      { label: 'Tap Water', text: 'Tap water in Italy is safe to drink everywhere. Rome\'s public drinking fountains (nasoni) provide fresh, cold water throughout the city — look for the small metal spouts on street corners. Restaurants may push bottled water (acqua minerale), but you can always ask for "acqua del rubinetto" (tap water).' },
      { label: 'Pickpocket Awareness', text: 'Pickpocketing is the primary safety concern in Rome, Florence, Naples, Milan, and Venice — especially on public transport, at tourist attractions, and in crowded markets. Use a money belt or front-zip bag. Keep your phone in your front pocket. Watch for distraction techniques: fake petitions, bracelet sellers, groups of children. Stay alert, and you\'ll be fine.' },
      { label: 'Driving Safety', text: 'Italian drivers are aggressive by Northern European or American standards. Motorways (autostrade) are toll roads — carry cash or a card for tolls. Speed cameras are everywhere and fines follow you home. Avoid driving in major city centers — ZTL cameras will ticket you automatically.' },

Carry a lightweight scarf or shawl in your day bag — you\'ll be turned away without one. This applies year-round.' },
      { label: 'Power Adapters', text: 'Italy uses Type L (3 round pins) and Type C (2 round pins) plugs at 230V. Bring a universal adapter or a European plug adapter. Your phone chargers and laptops are dual-voltage and work fine. Hair dryers and curling irons need to be rated 110-240V — check before plugging in.' },
      { label: 'Comfortable Walking Shoes', text: 'Italian cities are built on cobblestones, hills, and uneven stone paths. Wear proper walking shoes — not flip-flops, not brand-new shoes. Break them in before your trip. You\'ll walk 10-15 km per day easily in Rome, Florence, or Venice.' },
      { label: 'Sunscreen & Hat', text: 'Southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia get intense summer sun. Bring SPF 50+ sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses. The Mediterranean UV index hits 9-10+ in July and August. Sunburn can ruin beach days along the Amalfi Coast and Puglia.' },
      { label: 'Layers for Evening', text: 'Even in summer, Italian evenings cool down — especially in hill towns, lake regions, and northern cities. A light jacket or cardigan is essential for outdoor dining. Spring and fall require a proper jacket, especially in Milan, Venice, and the Dolomites.' },
      { label: 'Day Bag', text: 'Carry a crossbody bag or small backpack for daily exploring — phone, water bottle, sunscreen, adapter, and cash. Anti-theft bags with hidden zippers are worth the investment in Rome and Naples. Leave valuables in the hotel safe.' },

(how much?), "Il conto, per favore" (the bill, please), "Dov\'e il bagno?" (where\'s the bathroom?). Even a few words earn a warmer welcome.' },
      { label: 'Greetings & Formality', text: 'Italians greet with "Buongiorno" until early afternoon, then switch to "Buonasera." Use "Lei" (formal you) with strangers and older people. "Ciao" is informal — only use it with people you know or who say it first. A handshake is standard; close acquaintances do the two-cheek kiss (left first).' },
      { label: 'Dining Etiquette', text: 'Lunch is typically 12:30-2:30 PM, dinner 7:30-10:00 PM. Don\'t ask for butter with bread at dinner. Don\'t order cappuccino after 11 AM (espresso is fine anytime). Pasta is a first course, not a main — ordering only pasta is perfectly acceptable. "Coperto" is a cover charge, not a tip. Ask for "il conto" when ready — it won\'t come automatically.' },
      { label: 'Coffee Culture', text: 'Coffee at the bar (standing) is cheaper than sitting at a table. Espresso is the default — order "un caffe" and you\'ll get an espresso. Cappuccino is a morning drink only. "Caffe macchiato" is espresso with a dash of milk. Pay at the cassa (register) first in busy bars, then bring the receipt to the barista.' },
      { label: 'La Passeggiata', text: 'The evening stroll — Italians dress up and walk through town between 5-8 PM. It\'s social, leisurely, and one of the best ways to experience local life. Join in. It\'s the reason Italian towns feel so alive in the evening.' },
      { label: 'Regional Pride', text: 'Italy is intensely regional. Neapolitans, Romans, Florentines, Milanese, and Sicilians all have distinct identities, dialects, and cuisines. Don\'t compare regions or suggest one is better than another. Each city and region takes immense pride in its own traditions.' },

  <FAQ items={[
    { question: "Do I need a visa to visit Italy?", answer: "Most nationalities (US, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, and 50+ others) can enter Italy visa-free for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Italy is part of the Schengen Area, so this covers all Schengen countries combined. Starting in 2026, visa-exempt travelers will also need ETIAS authorization (7 EUR, valid for 3 years). Bring your passport with at least 3 months' validity beyond your departure date." },
    { question: "Is Italy safe for tourists?", answer: "Italy is very safe for tourists. Violent crime against visitors is extremely rare. The main concern is petty theft — pickpocketing is common in Rome, Florence, Naples, Milan, and Venice, especially on public transport and at tourist hotspots. Use common sense: carry a crossbody bag, keep your phone in a front pocket, be alert in crowds. Avoid walking alone in poorly lit areas at night. Tourist areas are well-policed." },
    { question: "How much does a trip to Italy cost?", answer: "Budget travelers: 50-80 EUR/day covers hostels, pizza al taglio, and public transport. Mid-range: 120-200 EUR/day for 3-star hotels, trattorias, and museum entry. Luxury: 300+ EUR/day for boutique hotels, fine dining, and private tours. A 7-day mid-range trip for two costs roughly 2,500-4,000 EUR total including accommodation, meals, transport, and activities." },
    { question: "What is the best way to get around Italy?", answer: "High-speed trains (Trenitalia Frecciarossa, Italo) connect major cities quickly and affordably — Rome to Florence is 1.5 hours, Rome to Naples is 70 minutes. Regional trains reach smaller towns. Rent a car for Tuscany, Puglia, Sicily, and the Amalfi Coast. Ferries connect the mainland to Sicily, Sardinia, Capri, and the Aeolian Islands. In cities, use metro, buses, or walk — most historic centers are compact." },
    { question: "When is the best time to visit Italy?", answer: "April-June and September-October offer the best combination of warm weather, manageable crowds, and lower prices. July-August is peak season — hot, crowded, and expensive, but perfect for beach destinations and island ferries. Ski season runs December-March in the Dolomites and Alps. Winter in cities like Rome and Florence is mild and uncrowded, with the best hotel deals." },
    { question: "Do I need to speak Italian?", answer: "English is widely spoken in tourist areas, hotels, and restaurants in major cities. Smaller towns and rural areas may have limited English. Learning basic phrases (Buongiorno, Grazie, Scusi, Per favore) goes a long way and earns genuine appreciation. Younger Italians generally speak some English; older generations may not. Google Translate works well offline if you download the Italian language pack." },
